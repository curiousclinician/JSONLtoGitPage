{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleepwalking","markdown":"**Sleepwalking** is a [non-rapid eye movement sleep disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/home \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:home\") characterized by repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about. Sleep walking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow-wave sleep and therefore most often occurring during the first third of the night.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nRecurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually occurring during the first third of the major sleep episode, accompanied by the following:\n\n1.  **Sleepwalking**: Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and walking about. While sleepwalking, the individual has a blank, staring face; is relatively unresponsive to the efforts of others to communicate with him or her; and can be awakened only with great difficulty.\n    \n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nNo or little (e.g. - only a single visual scene) dream imagery is recalled.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nAmnesia for the episodes is present.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe episodes cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication).\n\n##### Criterion F[](#criterion-f)\n\nCo-existing mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleepwalking.\n\nSleepwalking episodes can include a wide variety of behaviours. Episodes may begin with confusion: the individual may simply sit up in bed, look about, or pick at the blanket or sheet. This behaviour then becomes progressively complex. The individual may actually leave the bed and walk into closets, out of the room, and even out of buildings. Individuals may use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex behaviours. Running and frantic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most behaviours during sleep walking episodes are routine and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors and even operating machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking can also include inappropriate behaviour (e.g., commonly, urinating in a closet or waste basket). Most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted. Inasmuch as sleep is a state of relative analgesia, painful injuries sustained during sleep walking may not be appreciated until awakening after the fact.\n\nThere are two “specialized” forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behaviour and sleep-related sexual behaviour (sexsomnia or sleep sex). Individuals with sleep-related eating experience unwanted recurrent episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, ranging from no awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these episodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with sleep-related eating disorder may find evidence of their eating only the next morning. In sexsomnia, varying degrees of sexual activity (e.g., masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual intercourse) occur as complex behaviours arising from sleep without conscious awareness. This condition is more common in males and may result in serious interpersonal relationship problems or medico-legal consequences.\n\nNREM sleep arousal disorders occur most commonly in childhood and diminish in frequency with increasing age. The onset of sleepwalking in adults with no prior history of sleepwalking as children should prompt a search for specific etiologies, such as obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal seizures, or effect of medication.\n\nSedative use, sleep deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions, fatigue, and physical or emotional stress increase the likelihood of episodes. Fever and sleep deprivation can produce an increased frequency of NREM sleep arousal disorders. A family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may occur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwalk. The risk for sleepwalking is further increased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder.\n\nNREM sleep arousal disorders arise from any stage of NREM sleep but most commonly from deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep). They are most likely to appear in the first third of the night and do not commonly occur during daytime naps. During the episode, the polysomnogram may be obscured with movement artifact. In the absence of such artifact, the electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha frequency activity during the episode, indicating partial or incomplete arousal.\n\nPolysomnography in conjunction with audiovisual monitoring can be used to document episodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of actually capturing an event during a polysomnographic recording, there are no polysomnographic features that can serve as a marker for sleepwalking. Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event. As a group, individuals who sleepwalk show instability of deep NREM sleep, but the overlap in findings with individuals who do not sleepwalk is great enough to preclude use of this indicator in establishing a diagnosis.\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nYou can `**REM**`ember events (i.e. - no confusion, no amnesia) in REM parasomnias!\n\n#### Comparison of Parasomnias[](#comparison-of-parasomnias-1)\n\n|     | Parasomnia Type | Stage of Arousal | Time of Night | EEG during event | EMG during event | Unresponsive during event | Autonomic activity | Anmesia | Confusion post-episode | Family history of parasomnias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confusional Arousal | NREM | NREM Stage 2-4 | Anytime | N/A | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleepwalking](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleepwalking \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleepwalking\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleep terrors](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | High | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [REM sleep behaviour disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/2-rem-sleep-disorder/home \"sleep:parasomnias:2-rem-sleep-disorder:home\") | REM | REM | Anytime (but more likely later half) | Characteristic of REM | High | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n| [Nightmare disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") | REM | REM | Anytime | N/A | N/A | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Drakatos, P., Marples, L., Muza, R., Higgins, S., Gildeh, N., Macavei, R., ... & Leschziner, G.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder","markdown":"**Nightmare disorder** is a sleep disorder characterized by typically lengthy, elaborate, story-like sequences of dream imagery that seem real and that incite anxiety, fear, or other dysphoric emotions. Nightmare content typically focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with imminent danger but may involve themes that evoke other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring after traumatic experiences may replicate the threatening situation (“'replicative nightmares”), but most do not. On awakening, nightmares are well remembered and can be described in detail. They occur almost exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus occur through out sleep but are; more likely in the second half of the major sleep episode when dreaming is longer and more intense.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\nPrevalence of nightmares increases through childhood into adolescence. 1 to 4% of parents report that their preschool children have nightmares “often” or “always”. Prevalence increases from ages 10 to 13 for both males and females but continues to increase to ages 20-29 for females (while decreasing for males), when it can be twice as high for females as for males. Prevalence decreases steadily with age for both sexes, but the gender difference remains. Among adults, prevalence of nightmares at least monthly is 6%, whereas prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%-2%. Estimates often combine idiopathic and posttraumatic nightmares indiscriminately.\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nFactors that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep fragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate nightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset.\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nRepeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical integrity and that generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nOn awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented and alert.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nCoexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of dysphoric dreams.\n\n##### Specifiers[](#specifiers)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   During sleep onset\n    \n*   With associated non-sleep disorder, including substance use disorders\n    \n*   With associated other medical condition\n    \n*   With associated other sleep disorder\n    \n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **Acute**: Duration of period of nightmares is 1 month or less.\n    \n*   **Subacute**: Duration of period of nightmares is greater than 1 month but less than 6 months.\n    \n*   **Persistent**: Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater.\n    \n\nSeverity can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur:\n\n*   **Mild**: Less than one episode per week on average.\n    \n*   **Moderate**: One or more episodes per week but less than nightly.\n    \n*   **Severe**: Episodes nightly.\n    \n\nThere are key differences in the diagnostic criteria between [nightmares](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") and [sleep terrors (night terrors)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\"), and the table below outlines these differences. It is important to remember that night terrors occur during deep non-REM sleep (EEG shows a slow wave sleep pattern). Night terrors are technically not dreams, but more of a sudden reaction of fear that occurs during the transition from one sleep stage to another.\n\n#### Sleep Terrors (Night Terrors) vs. Nightmares[](#sleep-terrors-night-terrors-vs-nightmares)\n\nAdapted from Barton Schmitt, MD (2007)\n\n|     | [Sleep Terrors (Night Terrors)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\") | [Nightmares](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peak age | 1-4 years | 3-12 years |\n| Prevalence | 2% of children | 100% of children |\n| Sleep time | First 2 hours | Last 4 hours |\n| Stage of sleep | Stage 3/4 (slow wave sleep) | REM-related |\n| Movement | Active | Little |\n| Autonomic changes | Extreme | Mild |\n| Recognizes parent | No  | Yes |\n| Can awaken | No  | Yes |\n| Consolable | No  | Yes |\n| Dreams remembered | No  | Yes |\n| Confusion/disorientation | Yes | No  |\n| History of sleep walking | Yes | No  |\n| Difficult to console | Yes | No  |\n| Potential to hurt self/others | Yes | No  |\n\nIndividuals who experience nightmares report more frequent past adverse events, but not necessarily trauma, and often display personality disturbances or psychiatric diagnosis. Sleep deprivation or fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules that alter the timing, intensity, or quantity of REM sleep, can put individuals at risk for nightmares.\n\nPolysomnographic studies show abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually during the second half of the night, prior to report of a nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye movement rates may quicken or increase in variability before awakening. Nightmares following traumatic events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2, sleep. The typical sleep of individuals with nightmares is mildly impaired (e.g., reduced efficiency, less slow-wave sleep, more awakenings), with more frequent periodic leg movements in sleep and relative sympathetic nervous system activation after REM sleep deprivation.\n\nNightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including coronary heart disease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and can accompany medical treatments, such as hemodialysis, or withdrawal from medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently are comorbid with other mental disorders, including PTSD; insomnia disorder; schizophrenia; psychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality disorders; and grief during bereavement.\n\nA concurrent nightmare disorder diagnosis should only be considered when in dependent clinical attention is warranted (i.e. Criteria A-C are met). Otherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the appropriate comorbid category specifier. However, nightmare disorder may be diagnosed as a separate disorder in individuals with PTSD if the nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding other PTSD symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved).\n\nNightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behaviour disorder, PTSD, and acute stress disorder, but nightmare disorder may be independently diagnosed if nightmares preceded the condition and their frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The latter may be determined by asking whether nightmares were a problem before onset of the other disorder and whether they continued after other symptoms had remitted.\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nYou can `**REM**`ember events (i.e. - no confusion, no amnesia) in REM parasomnias!\n\n#### Comparison of Parasomnias[](#comparison-of-parasomnias-1)\n\n|     | Parasomnia Type | Stage of Arousal | Time of Night | EEG during event | EMG during event | Unresponsive during event | Autonomic activity | Anmesia | Confusion post-episode | Family history of parasomnias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confusional Arousal | NREM | NREM Stage 2-4 | Anytime | N/A | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleepwalking](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleepwalking \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleepwalking\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleep terrors](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | High | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [REM sleep behaviour disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/2-rem-sleep-disorder/home \"sleep:parasomnias:2-rem-sleep-disorder:home\") | REM | REM | Anytime (but more likely later half) | Characteristic of REM | High | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n| [Nightmare disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") | REM | REM | Anytime | N/A | N/A | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/substance-medication","markdown":"**Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder** is a sleep disorder characterized by a severe change to sleeping patterns enough to warrant independent clinical attention and judged to be primarily caused by the pharmacological effects of a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin exposure). Depending on the substance involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is reported. Insomnia type and day time sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia-type is seen less often. The mixed type is noted when more than one type of sleep disturbance-related symptom is present and none predominates. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for some substances can be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can occur 4 weeks after cessation of substance use, and the disturbance may have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course).\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nA prominent and severe disturbance in sleep.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThere is evidence from time history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):\n\n1.

The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in `Criterion A`.\n    \n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sleep disorder could include the following:\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a [delirium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/1-delirium \"cl:1-delirium\").\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n#### Specifiers[](#specifiers-1)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **[Insomnia type](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/2-insomnia-disorder \"sleep:2-insomnia-disorder\")**: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or non-restorative sleep.\n    \n*   **Daytime sleepiness type**: Characterized by predominant complaint of excessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.\n    \n*   **[Parasomnia type](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/home \"sleep:parasomnias:home\")**: Characterized by abnormal behavioural events during sleep.\n    \n*   **Mixed type**: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly predominates.\n    \n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **With onset during intoxication**: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for intoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intoxication period.\n    \n*   **With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal**: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symptoms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.\n    \n\n#### Onset Specifier[](#onset-specifier)\n\n**Specify if:** (see Table 1 in the DSM-5 chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):\n\n*   **With onset during intoxication**: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for intoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intoxication period.\n    \n*   **With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal**: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symptoms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.\n    \n\nAlcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During acute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect depending on dose, accompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following these initial effects, there may be increased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remaining sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and wakefulness and REM sleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual use, alcohol continues to show a short-lived sedative effect in the first half of the night, followed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal, there is extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount and intensity of REM sleep, associated frequently with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form, constitutes part of alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may continue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent deficit in slow-wave sleep.\n\n**Polysomnography**  \nWhile there are many functional consequences associated with sleep disorders, the only unique consequence for substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is increased risk for relapse. The degree of sleep disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep rebound predicts risk of relapse of drinking). Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful information on whether an individual is at increased risk for relapse.\n\nCaffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent manner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal.\n\nAcute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though arousing effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave sleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to the sleep-inducing and slow-wave sleep-enhancing effects develops. Upon withdrawal, sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported lasting for several weeks. Polysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep during this phase.\n\nOpioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of sleep, and reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With continued administration, tolerance to the sedative effects of opioids develops and there are complaints of insomnia. Consistent with their respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea.\n\nSedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methyprylon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic drugs produce the expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic use (particularly of barbiturates and the older non-barbiturate, non-benzodiazepine drugs) may cause tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur. Sedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep apnea events.\n\nParasomnias are associated with use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, especially when these medications are taken at higher doses and when they are combined with other sedative drugs. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use can lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of an exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1-2 days reported to occur even with short-term use.\n\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of action are most likely to produce complaints of rebound insomnia, whereas those with longer durations of action are more often associated with daytime sleepiness. Any sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentially cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or re bound insomnia.\n\n### Amphetamines and related substances and other stimulants[](#amphetamines-and-related-substances-and-other-stimulants)\n\nSleep disorders induced by amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by insomnia during intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal. During acute intoxication, stimulants reduce the total amount of sleep, increase sleep latency and sleep continuity disturbances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be reduced. During withdrawal from chronic stimulant use, there is both prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency tests may show increased daytime sleepiness during the withdrawal phase. Drugs like [34-methylenedioxyrnethamphetamine (MDMA or \"ecstasy\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/stimulants/mdma \"meds:stimulants:mdma\") and related substances lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 hours of intake; frequent use of these compounds is associated with persisting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, even during longer-term abstinence.\n\nChronic tobacco consumption is associated primarily with symptoms of insomnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reduction of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime sleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke heavily may experience regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving.\n\nOther substances/medications may produce sleep disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic nervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, anti histamines, corticosteroids).\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/hyponatremia","markdown":"**Hyponatremia** is an electrolyte disturbance of low serum sodium that can result in neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Eds. Maxine A. Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2017 New York, NY: McGraw-Hill)[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_detail/cl/hyponatremia-approach.png?id=cl%3Ahyponatremia)\n\nThere are numerous etiologies of hyponatremia. The correct treatment and management of hyponatremia depends on identifying the etiology of the hyponatremia. For example, one must differentiate between iatrogenic hyponatremia (typically due to thiazide diuretics, carbamazepine, antidepressants, or antipsychotics), idiopathic hyponatremia, or other etiologies (like hypothyroidism or alcoholism). Generally speaking, the majority of hyponatremias in the psychiatric population are associated with physiologically inappropriate (but not necessarily elevated) levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP), leading to water retention and serum hypotonicity.\n\n**Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)** can cause hyponatraemia.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) Many psychotropic medications can cause SIADH either by stimulating the release of vasopressin or by potentiating its action on the renal tubules. It is also thought that psychotropics may cause stimulation of central serotonin receptors as well. SIADH is a known side effect of antidepressants, especially in the elderly.\n\nSIADH is characterized by the following sequence of:\n\n1.  Excessive free water retention\n    \n2.  Euvolemic hyponatremia with continued urinary sodium excretion\n    \n3.  Urine osmolality > serum osmolality\n    \n\nSevere hyponatremia from SIADH can result in cerebral edema, and/or seizures. The treatment of SIAD consists of: (1) fluid restriction (first line), (2) salt tablets, (3) diuretics, (4) ADH antagonists, and/or (5) a slow correction of the hyponatremia with hypertonic saline to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis).\n\n**Psychogenic polydipsia (PPD)** (also known as primary polydipsia) is excessive and volitional water intake commonly patients with severe mental illness and/or developmental disability. Psychogenic polydipsia can cause hyponatremia, and is associated with minor impairments in water excretion.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) Psychogenic Polydipsia and PIP Syndrome can be considered synonymous diagnoses.\n\n**Psychosis, Intermittent hyponatremia, and Polydipsia Syndrome (PIP Syndrome)** is a triad of symptoms observed in psychiatric patients, particularly in those with schizophrenia and/or psychosis.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7) The underlying etiology of polydipsia (compulsive water consumption) in remains unclear. Hypotheses include impairment in central thirst regulation or drug therapy, which may cause an altered sensation of thirst.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8) Usually, symptoms of this syndrome are subclinical and patients are asymptomatic. However, in severe cases, mortality can occur when the polydipsia results in severe water intoxication.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n\nExcessive consumption of beer (which has a low solute content) to the exclusion of other fluid intake can result in severe hyponatremia, known as “beer potomania.”[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\nThe incidence of hyponatremia caused by SSRIs varies widely, from 0.5% to 32%. In the majority of cases, hyponatremia occurs within the first 2 to 4 weeks of the onset of therapy. The hyponatremia typically resolves 2 weeks after discontinuation of the SSRI, and the incidence returns back to population baseline after 3 months.[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)[\\[12\\]](#refnotes:1:note12)\n\n#### Hyponatremia Risk[](#hyponatremia-risk)\n\n| Higher Risk | Lower Risk |\n| --- | --- |\n| SSRIs (class effect), >5% | Mirtazapine (2.5%) |\n| SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) | MAOis (moclobemide) |\n| TCAs (noradrenergic ones such nortripyline, lofepramine might be safer) |     |\n\nIn rare cases, antipsychotics can cause hyponatremia.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13) Antipsychotics are thought to increase AVP release is increased despite normal plasma osmolality, resulting in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) causing hyponatremia.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between psychotropic-induced SIADH and psychogenic polydipsia. SIADH should be a diagnosis of exclusion. To differentiate between SIADH and psychogenic polydipsia, it is important to measure serum sodium, osmolality, and urine osmolality.\n\n#### Comparison of Various Electrolyte Disturbances[](#comparison-of-various-electrolyte-disturbances)\n\n|     | Hypo (Low Concentration) | Hyper (High Concentration) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sodium | [Hyponatremia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/hyponatremia \"cl:hyponatremia\"): Nausea, malaise, stupor, coma, seizures | Irritability, stupor, coma |\n| Potassium | [Hypokalemia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/hypokalemia \"cl:hypokalemia\"): Arrhythmias, muscle cramps, spasm, and weakness.

Thus, the causes of KBS are very broad, including dementias, encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, and neoplasms.\n\nKluver proposed both manifestations of KBS as either permanent or temporary:[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n##### Permanent Manifestations[](#permanent-manifestations)\n\n1.  **Hyperorality** (placing non-edible objects in mouth, making licking, sucking, and/or chewing movements)\n    \n2.  **Placidity**, blunted affect, and/or [apathy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/apathy \"teaching:apathy\")\n    \n3.  **Hypermetamorphosis** (excessive attentiveness to visual stimuli, and tendency to touch every these visual stimulus, regardless of the history or reward value of that object)\n    \n\n##### Temporary Manifestations[](#temporary-manifestations)\n\n1.  **Hypersexuality**\n    \n2.  **Dietary changes** (hyperphagia, [pica](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/eating-disorders/pica \"eating-disorders:pica\"), coprophagia) (rapid weight gain can occur in some patients, and some may [ingest inedible non-food items](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/eating-disorders/pica \"eating-disorders:pica\"))\n    \n3.  **Visual agnosia** (“psychic blindness”)\n    \n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\nKBS does not occur in isolation, but is usually accompanied with a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that can include [aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\"), cognitive impairment, [dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/home \"geri:dementia:home\"), and/or [seizures](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-seizures \"neurology:approach-seizures\").\n\nThe destruction of the bilateral temporal lobes (with amygdala involvement) bilaterally, results in a disturbance to the limbic networks that link to other cortical and subcortical circuits responsible for emotions and affect.\n\nTreatment of KBS is symptomatic and similar to how neuropsychiatric symptoms from [traumatic brain injury](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/tbi \"cl:tbi\") or [behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/1-bpsd \"geri:dementia:1-bpsd\") might be managed. The main classes of medications that can be used include antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (carbamazepine in particular),[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (e.g. - leuprorelin).\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}

High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\n*   **A**. At least `3` of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n    \n    *   (1) Elevated, expansive mood\n        \n    *   (2) Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity\n        \n    *   (3) More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking\n        \n    *   (4) Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n        \n    *   (5) Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)\n        \n    *   (6) Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g. - engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)\n        \n    *   (7) Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia)\n        \n*   **B**. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior\n    \n*   **C**. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be [bipolar I](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/bipolar/bipolar-i \"bipolar:bipolar-i\") or [bipolar II disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/bipolar/bipolar-ii \"bipolar:bipolar-ii\").\n    \n*   **D**. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)\n    \n\n**Note**: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\n*   **A**. `1` of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n    \n    *   (1) Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n        \n    *   (2) Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens)\n        \n*   **B**. `3` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood,\n        \n    *   (2) Depression that is regularly worse in the morning\n        \n    *   (3) Early-morning awakening (i.e. - at least `2` hours before usual awakening)\n        \n    *   (4) Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation\n        \n    *   (5) Significant anorexia or weight loss\n        \n    *   (6) Excessive or inappropriate guilt\n        \n\nThis specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder.\n\n*   **A**. Mood reactivity (i.e. - mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)\n    \n*   **B**. `2` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) Significant weight gain or increase in appetite\n        \n    *   (2) Hypersomnia\n        \n    *   (3) Leaden paralysis (i.e. - heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)\n        \n    *   (4) A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment\n        \n*   **C**. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode\n    \n\nDelusions and/or hallucinations are present.\n\n*   **With mood-congruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment\n        \n*   **With mood-incongruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes\n        \n\nThis specifier can apply to an episode of depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode.\n\nThis specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode, most recent episode of major depression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the `4` weeks following delivery.\n\nThis specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.\n\n*   **A**. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g. - in the fall or winter). Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g. - regularly being unemployed every winter).\n    \n*   **B**. Full remissions also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g. - depression disappears in the spring)\n    \n*   **C**. In the last `2` years, `2` major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same period.\n    \n*   **D**. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.\n    \n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\n**Atypical Depression** is a depression characterized by mood reactivity (moods that are strongly reactive to environmental circumstances, and feeling extremely sensitive - this is a must have feature), hypersomnia, carbohydrate craving/increased appetite, leaden paralysis (profound fatigue), and chronic rejection sensitivity. Atypical depression results in more disability than melancholic depression, because individuals often have more interpersonal difficulties. Atypical depression patients lack classic melancholic depression features such as insomnia, weight loss, loss of reactivity of mood.\n\n#### Are atypical depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder overlapping conditions?[](#are-atypical-depression-borderline-personality-disorder-bipolar)\n\nThe common feature in all these diagnoses are emotional dysregulation and mood reactivity. The research hints that these disorders may all exist on a continuum.[\\[18\\]](#refnotes:1:note18)[\\[19\\]](#refnotes:1:note19)[\\[20\\]](#refnotes:1:note20) Clinically, it can be challenging to distinguish between these disorders.\n\n### Childhood and Adolescent[](#childhood-and-adolescent)\n\n**Childhood and Adolescent Depression** is a subtype of [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") characterized by low mood, anxiety, and irritability in children and youth.\n\n**Melancholic Depression** (also known as **Major Depressive Disorder with melancholic features** in the DSM-5, and previously as “endogenous depression”) is a subtype of [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") characterized by a severe loss of pleasure and prominent physical symptoms. Classic melancholic depression features include insomnia, weight loss, and psychomotor changes.\n\n**Geriatric Depression** is one of the major geriatric giants (dementia, delirium, and depression). As a treatment population, special considerations need to be taken into account.\n\n**Post-Stroke Depression (PSD)** can develop acutely after a stroke, and associated with poorer functional outcomes.\n\n### Peripartum and Postpartum[](#peripartum-and-postpartum)\n\n**Postpartum Depression (PPD)** (also known as **Peripartum Depression**, or **Major Depressive Disorder with peripartum onset** in the DSM-5) is a subtype of [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") that occurs during pregnancy or in the first `4` weeks after delivery. However, women remain at risk for developing depression up to several months following delivery. PPD is the most common psychiatric complication related to child-bearing.\n\n**Psychotic Depression** (also known as **Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features** in the DSM-5) is a subtype of [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") characterized by psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) in addition to mood changes. It requires the treatment of the underlying mood disorder first to resolve the psychosis.\n\n**Perimenopausal Depression** (also known as **Major Depressive Disorder with peripartum onset** in the DSM-5) is a subtype of [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") experienced by women during the perimenopausal period, defined as the interval when a women’s menstrual cycles become irregular, usually between ages of 45 and 49.\n\n**Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)** is a subtype of depression with a usual annual onset between September-November with spontaneous remission in April-May. There is generally an increased prevalence in countries the father it is from the equator (interestingly, Iceland has low rates of SAD[\\[21\\]](#refnotes:1:note21)). The development of SAD is thought to be due to dark/grey conditions in the winter season, and lack of light availability. Fluctuations in circadian rhythms and melatonin release also plays a role.[\\[22\\]](#refnotes:1:note22) SAD can be considered as an evolutionary phenomenon and many individuals have non-clinical symptoms of SAD. Clinically symptomatic SAD can occur in up to 2.6% of the Canadian population, with premenopausal women most affected. Individuals with certain serotonin transporter genotypes may be more predisposed to SAD.[\\[23\\]](#refnotes:1:note23) [Bupropion](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ndri/bupropion \"meds:antidepressants:ndri:bupropion\") has been shown to be effective in the prevention of SAD by starting treatment prior to the winter season.[\\[24\\]](#refnotes:1:note24)\n\n**Situational Depression** (also known as **Reactive Depression**, **Exogenous Depression**, and **[Adjustment Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/trauma-and-stressors/adjustment \"trauma-and-stressors:adjustment\")**) are depressive symptoms that occur when an individual is unable to adjust to or cope with a particular stress or a major life event. This was a previously historical diagnosis that has fallen out of clinical use. Its close counterpart is now called [adjustment disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/trauma-and-stressors/adjustment \"trauma-and-stressors:adjustment\"), which reflects much of the same symptoms.\n\nSuicide is the most serious consequence of a major depressive episode. Suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts are highly prevalent in depression. The risk for suicidal behaviour is present at all times during a depressive episode. Thus, a [suicide risk assessment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/suicide-risk-assessment-sra \"teaching:suicide-risk-assessment-sra\") should be done as part of routine clinical care. Certain risk factors place an individual for higher risk of suicide, with a past history of suicide attempts or behaviours being the highest risk factor.\n\n#### Risk Factors for Suicide During a Depressive Episode[](#risk-factors-for-suicide-during-a-depressive-episode)\n\nLam, Raymond W., et al.

Atypical depression results in more disability than [melancholic depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/melancholic \"mood:1-depression:melancholic\"), because individuals often have more interpersonal difficulties.\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\nIn addition to meeting the criteria for [major depressive disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\"), the following specifier criteria are required to make the diagnosis of atypical depression:\n\n#### With atypical features[](#with-atypical-features)\n\nThis specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder.\n\n*   **A**. Mood reactivity (i.e. - mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)\n    \n*   **B**. `2` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) Significant weight gain or increase in appetite\n        \n    *   (2) Hypersomnia\n        \n    *   (3) Leaden paralysis (i.e. - heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)\n        \n    *   (4) A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment\n        \n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**RAILS**` can be used to remember the features of atypical depression.\n\n*   `**R**` - Reactivity in mood\n    \n*   `**A**` - Appetite increase\n    \n*   `**I**` - Interpersonal rejection sensitivity\n    \n*   `**L**` - Leaden paralysis\n    \n*   `**S**` - Sleep increase\n    \n\n#### Are atypical depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder overlapping conditions?[](#are-atypical-depression-borderline-personality-disorder-bipolar)\n\nThe common feature in all these diagnoses are emotional dysregulation and mood reactivity.

The diagnostic specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be describe a seasonal pattern of symptoms in both [major depressive disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\") and [bipolar disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/bipolar/bipolar-i \"bipolar:bipolar-i\").\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nThis specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least `1` type of episode (i.e. - mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nThere has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g. - in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g. - regularly being unemployed every winter).\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nFull remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g. - depression disappears in the spring)\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nIn the last `2` years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no non-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that `2`\\-year period.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nSeasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** American Psychiatric Association.

High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\n*   **A**. At least `3` of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n    \n    *   (1) Elevated, expansive mood\n        \n    *   (2) Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity\n        \n    *   (3) More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking\n        \n    *   (4) Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n        \n    *   (5) Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)\n        \n    *   (6) Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g. - engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)\n        \n    *   (7) Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia)\n        \n*   **B**.

The level of severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision.\n\n*   **Mild:** BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2\n    \n*   **Moderate:** BMI = 16 to 16.99 kg/m2\n    \n*   **Severe:** BMI = 15 to 15.99 kg/m2\n    \n*   **Extreme:** BMI < 15 kg/m2\n    \n\n**Note**: a BMI = 18.5 kg/m2 has been used by the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the lower limit of normal body weight.

Rather it a heterogenous condition with a variety of causes (most of which are unknown or still being researched). Each patient with a diagnosis of schizophrenia will present with a different set or cluster of symptoms. Even the DSM-5 and ICD each have different conceptualizations of the disease. Additionally, psychosis is a syndrome and not a diagnosis. For example, in rare cases, patients initially diagnosed with schizophrenia may in fact be misdiagnosed and have [anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/anti-nmda-receptor \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:anti-nmda-receptor\"). Medications and substance use may also [cause psychosis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychosis/substance-medication \"psychosis:substance-medication\").\n\n##### Future Research[](#future-research)\n\nA wide variety of mental disorders and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms, and _**must**_ be considered in the differential diagnosis of a schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia diagnosis, or any diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder.[\\[52\\]](#refnotes:1:note52)\n\nThe term psychosis has been defined in various ways in the medical literature over time.

About one-third (34%) of cases are characterized by mania and/or agitation, with irritability being much more common than elevated mood. Around another 40% of cases are predominantly characterized by depression and/or anxiety, while the remaining 25% have an atypical or mixed profile.[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\n## Screening Tools and Scales[](#screening-tools-and-scales)\n\nThere is no standardized questions or screening tool for postpartum psychosis due to the wide range of signs and symptoms. Asking patients about a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances post-childbirth, and for suicidal or infanticidal ideation is important.\n\nRapid changes in estrogen and progesterone in the 24 hours following childbirth is thought to play a role in the development of most postpartum psychiatric disorders. However, this remains poorly understood. Certain women may have a particular vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations that increases their risk for psychosis.[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11) Other etiologies may include biological triggers such as immune dysregulation.\n\nCommon investigations include basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, urine toxicology screen, TSH, free T4, and TPO antibodies.\n\nA complete physical and neurological examination should be performed. If neurological symptoms present, brain imaging and work up for [limbic encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/home \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:home\") may be warranted.\n\nPPP is considered a psychiatric emergency, and requires immediate hospitalization and treatment. Due to ethical considerations and rarity of the condition, well-designed studies are difficult to do.

An example of an encephalopathy would be [Wernicke Encephalopathy and Korsakoff Syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/wernicke-korsakoff \"cl:wernicke-korsakoff\").\n    \n\n#### Early Diagnosis is Important![](#early-diagnosis-is-important)\n\nEarly identification of autoimmune encephalitis is important, so immunotherapy can begin quickly. Early treatment is associated with decreased seizure frequency, faster cognitive improvement, and improved survival.\n\n#### Children Are Not Little Adults[](#children-are-not-little-adults)\n\nChildren do not develop many of the autoimmune encephalitis disorders that affect adults, and the presentation might be clinically different. Thus, the diagnostic criteria need to be carefully applied in children younger than 5 years.\n\nMost causes of encephalitis were previously thought to be of infectious origin, and as a result, most current guidelines assume an infectious ethology in order for a diagnosis to occur. However, in the last decade, _autoimmune_ causes of encephalitis are increasingly being recognized. With autoimmune encephalitis, the core symptoms can resemble that of an infectious encephalitis. However, certain forms of autoimmune encephalitis can include neurological and psychiatric manifestations without fever or CSF pleocytosis. For example, autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) should be considered in patients presenting with rapidly progressive memory impairment, behavioural or psychiatric changes, or seizures of unknown etiology.\n\n**Autoimmune Encephalitis** (AE) refers to a group of conditions including: autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, [anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/anti-nmda-receptor \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:anti-nmda-receptor\"), and Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis.\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `all 3` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n1.  **Subacute onset** (rapid progression of less than 3 months) of working memory deficits (short-term memory loss), altered mental status\\*, or psychiatric symptoms\n    \n2.  **At least `1` of the following**:\n    \n\n#### Footnotes[](#footnotes)\n\n*   Memory deficits = inability to form new long-term memories due to hippocampal dysfunction, or problems with working memory\n    \n*   \\* = Altered mental status defined as decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy, or personality change\n    \n*   † = Brain MRI hyperintense signal on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences highly restricted to one or both medial temporal lobes (limbic encephalitis), or in multifocal areas involving grey matter, white matter, or both compatible with demyelination or inflammation\n    \n\nThe symptoms of **Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis (ALE)** are due to dysfunction of the limbic structures in the brain. This can include short-term memory impairment, behavioural changes, anxiety, depression, psychosis, and seizures. ALE most often occurs in middle-aged adults, but it can individuals of all ages.\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `all 4` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n1.  **Subacute onset** (rapid progression of less than 3 months) of working memory deficits, seizures, or psychiatric symptoms suggesting involvement of the limbic system\n    \n2.  **Bilateral brain abnormalities that is highly restricted to the medial temporal lobes**† on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) [MRI](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/mri \"neurology:mri\")\n    \n3.  **At least `1` of the following**:\n    \n\n#### Footnotes[](#footnotes-1)\n\n*   \\* = If one of the first three criteria is not met, a diagnosis of definite limbic encephalitis can be made only with the detection of antibodies against cell-surface, synaptic, or onconeural proteins.\n    \n*   † = 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET can be used to fulfil this criterion. Results from studies from the past 5 years suggest that 18F-FDG-PET imaging might be more sensitive than MRI to show an increase in FDG uptake in normal-appearing medial temporal lobes.\n    \n\n**Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis** is a monophasic CNS inflammatory disease that mainly occurs in children and adults younger than 40 years. The disorder can be triggered by an acute systemic infection or vaccination. Symptoms include cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, hemiparesis, myelopathy, or optic neuritis. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies can transiently occur in almost 50% of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `all 5` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\n1.  **A first multifocal, clinical CNS event of presumed inflammatory demyelinating cause**\n    \n2.  **Encephalopathy that cannot be explained by fever**\n    \n3.  **Abnormal brain MRI**:\n    \n4.  **No new clinical or MRI findings after 3 months of symptom onset**\n    \n\n**Anti-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) Receptor Encephalitis** is an autoimmune encephalitis that is often characterized by prominent psychiatric manifestations that can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is associated with CSF IgG antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor.\n\n##### Probable anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis[](#probable-anti-nmda-receptor-encephalitis)\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `all 3` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6)\n\n1.  **Rapid onset (less than 3 months) of at least `4` of the 6 following major groups of symptoms**:\n    \n2.  **At least `1` of the following laboratory study results**:\n    \n\n#### Systemic Teratomas[](#systemic-teratomas)\n\nA probable diagnosis can also be made in the presence of 3 of the above groups of symptoms accompanied by a systemic teratoma.\n\n##### Definite anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis[](#definite-anti-nmda-receptor-encephalitis)\n\nA Definite diagnosis can be made in the presence of `1` or more of the 6 major groups of symptoms and IgG anti-GluN1 antibodies (including CSF testing), after reasonable exclusion of other disorders\n\n**Bickerstaff’s Brainstem Encephalitis** is characterized by a subacute onset (less than 4 weeks) of progressive impairment of consciousness along with ataxia and bilateral, mostly symmetrical, ophthalmoparesis. Patients frequently develop pupillary abnormalities, bilateral facial palsy, Babinski’s sign, and bulbar palsy. Generalized limb weakness can occur and overlap with features of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n##### Probable Bickerstaff’s Brainstem Encephalitis[](#probable-bickerstaff-s-brainstem-encephalitis)\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `both` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\n1.  **Subacute onset (rapid progression of less than 4 weeks) of `all` the following symptoms**:\n    \n\n##### Definite Bickerstaff’s Brainstem Encephalitis[](#definite-bickerstaff-s-brainstem-encephalitis)\n\nDiagnosis can be made in the presence of positive IgG anti-GQ1b antibodies even if bilateral external ophthalmoplegia is not complete or ataxia cannot be assessed, or if recovery has occurred within 12 weeks after onset\n\n**Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (HE)** is a rare, clinically heterogeneous disorder associated with positive thyroid autoantibodies. It is increasingly recognized as an important and treatable cause of autoimmune encephalitis. anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-dsDNA can be elevated.\n\nDiagnosis can be made when `all 6` of the following criteria have been met (Graus et al. 2016):[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8)\n\n1.  **Encephalopathy with seizures, myoclonus, hallucinations, or stroke-like episodes**\n    \n2.  **Subclinical or mild overt thyroid disease** (usually hypothyroidism)\n    \n3.  **Brain MRI normal or with non-specific abnormalities**\n    \n4.  **Presence of serum thyroid** antibodies (thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin)\n    \n5.  **Absence of well characterized neuronal antibodies in serum and CSF**\n    \n\nIn light of the recent developments in autoimmune encephalitis research, some researchers have proposed a new diagnostic category of “autoimmune psychosis”. The following are proposed diagnostic criteria for _possible_, _probable_, and _definite_ autoimmune psychoses from a 2020 position paper in the Lancet.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n\nNote that the below criteria do not exclude a diagnosis being made in a patient with an acute onset (<`3` months) of psychosis, even if that patient has had a previous psychotic, other psychiatric, or encephalopathic episode that resolved.\n\n##### Possible Autoimmune Psychosis[](#possible-autoimmune-psychosis)\n\nProposed diagnostic criteria for **possible** autoimmune psychosis (Pollak et. al, 2020):[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\nThe patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset (rapid progression of <`3` months) with at least `1` of the following:\n\n1.  Currently or recently diagnosed with a tumour\n    \n2.  Movement disorder (catatonia or dyskinesia)\n    \n3.  Adverse response to antipsychotics, raising suspicion of [neuroleptic malignant syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\") (rigidity, hyperthermia, or raised creatine kinase)\n    \n4.  Severe or disproportionate cognitive dysfunction\n    \n5.  A decreased level of consciousness\n    \n6.  The occurrence of seizures that are not explained by a previously known seizure disorder\n    \n7.  A clinically significant autonomic dysfunction (abnormal or unexpectedly fluctuant blood pressure, temperature, or heart rate)\n    \n\nIf a patient has possible autoimmune psychosis, investigations may include [electroencephalography](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/eeg \"neurology:eeg\"), [MRI](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/mri \"neurology:mri\"), serum autoantibodies, and [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/lumbar-puncture-lp \"neurology:lumbar-puncture-lp\") analysis (including CSF autoantibodies). The results should lead to a diagnosis of non-autoimmune psychosis or probable/definite autoimmune psychosis.\n\n##### Probable Autoimmune Psychosis[](#probable-autoimmune-psychosis)\n\nFor a diagnosis of **probable** autoimmune psychosis (Pollak et. al, 2020):[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)\n\nThe patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset (rapid progression of <`3` months) with at least `1` of the 7 clinical criteria listed above for possible autoimmune psychosis and at least one of the following:\n\n1.  CSF pleocytosis of >5 white blood cells per μL\n    \n2.  Bilateral brain abnormalities on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI highly restricted to the medial temporal lobes\n    \n\nOr `2` of the following:\n\n1.  Electroencephalogram encephalopathic changes (i.e. - spikes, spike-wave activity, or rhythmic slowing \\[intermittent rhythmic delta or theta activity\\] focal changes, or extreme delta brush\n    \n2.  CSF oligoclonal bands or increased IgG index\n    \n3.  The presence of a serum anti-neuronal antibody detected by cell-based assay\n    \n\nAnd after exclusion of alternative diagnoses.\n\n##### Definite Autoimmune Psychosis[](#definite-autoimmune-psychosis)\n\nFor a diagnosis of **definite** autoimmune psychosis (Pollak et. al, 2020):[\\[12\\]](#refnotes:1:note12)\n\n#### Red Flags[](#red-flags)\n\nRed flags for suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis in patients with psychosis:\n\n*   Infectious prodrome\n    \n*   New-onset severe headache or clinically significant change in headache pattern\n    \n*   Rapid progression\n    \n*   Adverse response to antipsychotics or presence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n    \n*   Insufficient response to antipsychotics\n    \n*   Movement disorder (e.g. - catatonia or dyskinesia)\n    \n*   Focal neurological disease\n    \n*   Decreased consciousness\n    \n*   Autonomic disturbance\n    \n*   Aphasia, mutism, or dysarthria\n    \n*   Seizures\n    \n*   Presence of a tumour, or history of a recent tumour\n    \n*   Hyponatraemia (not explained by side-effects of medication, eg, SSRIs, carbamazepine, and others)\n    \n*   Other autoimmune disorders (e.g. - systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroid disease)\n    \n*   Paraesthesia\n    \n\n**Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE)** is a rare neurological syndrome associated with cancer, and selectively affects limbic system structures, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13) It is usually associated with small cell lung cancer. The encephalitis is caused by an altered immunologic response to a malignancy that has antigens that resemble limbic antigens. The inflammatory response, however, occurs away from the original neoplasm site. [\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)\n\n[MRI](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/mri \"neurology:mri\") often shows increased signal on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging in the medial aspect of the temporal lobes. Although limbic encephalitis can occur with MRI evidence of unilateral involvement (or be normal) they are not considered to definite limbic encephalitis _unless_ specific antibodies are subsequently detected. Unilateral involvement should raise the suspicion for other etiologies including herpes simplex virus encephalitis, varicella zoster virus, tuberculosis and neurosyphilis.[\\[16\\]](#refnotes:1:note16) Non-infectious etiologies such as gliomas may also be mistaken for encephalitis on neuroimaging.\n\n[Electroencephalogram (EEG)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/eeg \"neurology:eeg\") usually shows slow-wave activity or epileptiform discharges from the temporal lobes, suggestive of underlying inflammation. Clinically, any EEG that shows slow-wave activity or epileptiform discharges from the temporal lobes in a patient who meets criteria for possible ALE should raise suspicion of the ALE (even if neuroimaging is normal). Occasionally there can be a normal EEG, which does not rule out the diagnosis. Extreme delta brush can be seen specifically in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\n### LP and CSF[](#lp-and-csf)\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can show leukocyte pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands, which supports a diagnosis of ALE in the appropriate clinical context. However, there is low sensitivity. CSF can be helpful to exclude herpes simplex virus encephalitis as a differential diagnosis.\n\nVarious bloodwork can be considered:[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17)[\\[18\\]](#refnotes:1:note18)\n\n#### Antibodies against synaptic receptors[](#antibodies-against-synaptic-receptors)\n\n| Antibody | Syndrome | Characteristics | Main tumour association | Tumour frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NMDA receptor | Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis | Predominantly affects young individuals (<45 years) and females.

Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior\n    \n*   **C**. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania\n    \n*   **D**. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)\n    \n\n* * *\n\n**Depressive episode, with mixed features**:\n\n*   **A**. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least `3` of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of depression:\n    \n    *   (1) Elevated, expansive mood\n        \n    *   (2) Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity\n        \n    *   (3) More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking\n        \n    *   (4) Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n        \n    *   (5) Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)\n        \n    *   (6) Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g. - engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)\n        \n        *   (7) Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia)\n            \n*   **B**. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior\n    \n*   **C**. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features\n    \n*   **D**. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment)\n    \n\n**Note**: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\nThis specifier (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II disorder). There is presence of at least `4` mood episodes in the previous `12` months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode.\n\n**Note**: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of at least `4` mood episodes during the previous `12` months. These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions of at least `2` months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g. - major depressive episode to manic episode). Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid cycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g. - cocaine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition.\n\n[Hypothyroidism](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/thyroid-disorders/hypothyroidism \"cl:thyroid-disorders:hypothyroidism\"), antidepressant use, and substance use is associated with rapid cycling. So assessing thyroid function, stopping any offending antidepressants, stimulants, and other psychotropics that might contribute to cycling is critical!\n\n*   **A**. `1` of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n    \n    *   (1) Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n        \n    *   (2) Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens)\n        \n*   **B**. `3` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood,\n        \n    *   (2) Depression that is regularly worse in the morning\n        \n    *   (3) Early-morning awakening (i.e. - at least `2` hours before usual awakening)\n        \n    *   (4) Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation\n        \n    *   (5) Significant anorexia or weight loss\n        \n    *   (6) Excessive or inappropriate guilt\n        \n\nThis specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode.\n\n*   **A**. Mood reactivity (i.e. - mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)\n    \n*   **B**. `2` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) Significant weight gain or increase in appetite\n        \n    *   (2) Hypersomnia\n        \n    *   (3) Leaden paralysis (i.e. - heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)\n        \n    *   (4) A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment\n        \n*   **C**. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode\n    \n\nDelusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the episode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incongruent:\n\n*   **With mood-congruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment\n        \n*   **With mood-incongruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes\n        \n\nThis specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode.\n\nThis specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the `4` weeks following delivery.\n\nThis specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least `1` type of episode (i.e. - mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\n\n*   **A**. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g. - in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g. - regularly being unemployed every winter).\n    \n*   **B**. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g. - depression disappears in the spring)\n    \n*   **C**. In the last `2` years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no non-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that `2`\\-year period.\n    \n*   **D**. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.\n    \n\n## Screening and Rating Scales[](#screening-and-rating-scales)\n\n#### Psychometric Scales for Bipolar Disorder[](#psychometric-scales-for-bipolar-disorder)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) | Clinician | Most frequently utilized to assess manic symptoms. 11 items on the patient’s subjective report over the last 48 hours plus clinical observations.[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17) Takes 15–30 minutes to complete. | [YMRS Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/mood/young-mania-rating-scale.pdf \"mood:young-mania-rating-scale.pdf (329.7 KB)\") |\n| Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) | Patient | The MDQ screens for bipolar spectrum disorder, (which includes Bipolar I, Bipolar II and unspecified bipolar disorder).

Both of these genes for for ion channels, and suggest that channelopathies may play a role in the development of bipolar disorder.[\\[22\\]](#refnotes:1:note22) Other candidate genes for bipolar disorder include:\n\nThere are key differences in the diagnostic criteria between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder.

Patients often fail (unintentionally) to report hypomanic/manic episodes as well.

This is for two reasons:\n\n*   **Contraception efficacy**: many of the treatments used in bipolar disorder, especially anticonvulsants (such as carbamazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine) can significantly reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCPs), and increase the risk for unintended pregnancy. On the flipside, OCPs can also reduce the efficacy of medications like lamotrigine.\n    \n*   **Teratogenicity**: valproate products (valproic acid, divalproex) have high teratogenic potential and also increase the risk for developmental disorders in infants exposed to valproate _in utero_. Thus, women on valproate products should be on contraception, and informed about the risks of using valproate during pregnancy. Additionally, individuals wishing to become pregnant should work with their clinician to switch off from valproate.\n    \n\n##### Acute Mania[](#acute-mania)\n\n#### Pharmacological Treatments for Acute Mania in Bipolar I[](#pharmacological-treatments-for-acute-mania-in-bipolar-i)\n\nAdapted from: Yatham, L. et al.

The depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic episode must last at least 4 days.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a1)\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b1)\n\nDuring the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, at least `3` of the following symptoms have persisted (`4` symptoms if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual behaviour, and have been present to a significant degree:\n\n1.  **Distractibility** (i.e. - attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n    \n2.  **Indiscretion**, characterized by excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g. - unrestrained buying sprees, sexual behaviours, or foolish business investments).\n    \n3.  **Grandiosity** or inflated self-esteem.\n    \n4.  **Flight of ideas** or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n    \n5.  **Activity (goal-directed) increasing** (e.g. - either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.\n    \n6.  **Sleep** decreased (e.g. - feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n    \n7.  **Talkative** (more than usual or pressure to keep talking)\n    \n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**DIGFAST**` can be used to remember the criteria for bipolar I and II disorder.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6)\n\n*   `**D**` - **Distractibility**\n    \n*   `**I**` - **Indiscretion**\n    \n*   `**G**` - **Grandiosity**\n    \n\n*   `**F**` - **Flight of ideas**\n    \n*   `**A**` - **Activity increased**\n    \n*   `**S**` - **Sleep decreased**\n    \n*   `**T**` - **Talkativeness**\n    \n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c1)\n\nThe episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d1)\n\nThe disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\n##### Criterion F[](#criterion-f)\n\nThe episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment) or another medical condition.\n\n#### What If There is an Antidepressant-induced Hypomania?[](#what-if-there-is-an-antidepressant-induced-hypomania)\n\nA full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g. - medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that `1` or `2` symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a true bipolar disorder.\n\n#### Episode Specifier[](#episode-specifier)\n\n**Specify current or most recent episode**:\n\n*   **Hypomanic**\n    \n*   **Depressed**\n    \n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier)\n\n*   **Mild**: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\n    \n*   **Moderate**: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\n    \n*   **Severe**: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n    \n\n#### Remission Specifier[](#remission-specifier)\n\n*   **In partial remission**: Symptoms of the immediately previous manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than `2` months without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode following the end of such an episode.\n    \n*   **In full remission**: During the past `2` months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.\n    \n\n*   At least `2` of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or depression:\n    \n    *   (1) Feeling keyed up or tense\n        \n    *   (2) Feeling unusually restless\n        \n    *   (3) Difficulty concentrating because of worry\n        \n    *   (4) Fear that something awful may happen\n        \n    *   (5) Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself\n        \n*   **Severity**:\n    \n    *   **Mild**: `2` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Moderate**: `3` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Moderate-severe**: `4` or `5` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Severe**: `4` or `5` symptoms and with motor agitation\n        \n\n**Note**: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\nThe mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder:\n\n**Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features**:\n\n*   **A**. Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and at least `3` of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania:\n    \n    *   (1) Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective report (e.g. - feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g. - appears tearful)\n        \n    *   (2) Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others)\n        \n    *   (3) Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observable by others and not merely subjective feelings of being slowed down)\n        \n    *   (4) Fatigue or loss of energy\n        \n    *   (5) Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)\n        \n    *   (6) Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide\n        \n*   **B**.

For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania\n    \n*   **D**. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)\n    \n\n* * *\n\n**Depressive episode, with mixed features**:\n\n*   **A**. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least `3` of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of depression:\n    \n    *   (1) Elevated, expansive mood\n        \n    *   (2) Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity\n        \n    *   (3) More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking\n        \n    *   (4) Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n        \n    *   (5) Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)\n        \n    *   (6) Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g. - engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)\n        \n        *   (7) Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia)\n            \n*   **B**. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior\n    \n*   **C**. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features\n    \n*   **D**. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment)\n    \n\n**Note**: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\nThis specifier (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II disorder). There is presence of at least `4` mood episodes in the previous `12` months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode.\n\n**Note**: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of at least `4` mood episodes during the previous `12` months. These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions of at least `2` months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g. - major depressive episode to manic episode). Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid cycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g. - cocaine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition.\n\n[Hypothyroidism](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/thyroid-disorders/hypothyroidism \"cl:thyroid-disorders:hypothyroidism\"), antidepressant use, and substance use is associated with rapid cycling. So assessing thyroid function, stopping any offending antidepressants, stimulants, and other psychotropics that might contribute to cycling is critical!\n\n*   **A**. `1` of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n    \n    *   (1) Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n        \n    *   (2) Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens)\n        \n*   **B**. `3` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood,\n        \n    *   (2) Depression that is regularly worse in the morning\n        \n    *   (3) Early-morning awakening (i.e. - at least `2` hours before usual awakening)\n        \n    *   (4) Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation\n        \n    *   (5) Significant anorexia or weight loss\n        \n    *   (6) Excessive or inappropriate guilt\n        \n\nThis specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode.\n\n*   **A**. Mood reactivity (i.e. - mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)\n    \n*   **B**. `2` or more of the following:\n    \n    *   (1) Significant weight gain or increase in appetite\n        \n    *   (2) Hypersomnia\n        \n    *   (3) Leaden paralysis (i.e. - heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)\n        \n    *   (4) A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment\n        \n*   **C**. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode\n    \n\nDelusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the episode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incongruent:\n\n*   **With mood-congruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment\n        \n*   **With mood-incongruent psychotic features**:\n    \n    *   The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes\n        \n\nThis specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode.\n\nThis specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the `4` weeks following delivery.\n\nThis specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least `1` type of episode (i.e. - mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\n\n*   **A**. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g. - in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g. - regularly being unemployed every winter).\n    \n*   **B**. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g. - depression disappears in the spring)\n    \n*   **C**. In the last `2` years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no non-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that `2`\\-year period.\n    \n*   **D**. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.\n    \n\n## Screening and Rating Scales[](#screening-and-rating-scales)\n\n#### Psychometric Scales for Bipolar Disorder[](#psychometric-scales-for-bipolar-disorder)\n\nName\n\nRater\n\nDescription\n\nDownload\n\nYoung Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)\n\nClinician\n\nMost frequently utilized to assess manic symptoms. 11 items on the patient’s subjective report over the last 48 hours plus clinical observations.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7) Takes 15–30 minutes to complete.\n\n[YMRS Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/mood/young-mania-rating-scale.pdf \"mood:young-mania-rating-scale.pdf (329.7 KB)\")\n\nMood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)\n\nPatient\n\nThe MDQ screens for bipolar spectrum disorder, (which includes Bipolar I, Bipolar II and unspecified bipolar disorder).

However, a fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g. - with an antidepressant, electroconvulsive therapy, or light therapy) or drug of abuse, and persists _beyond_ the physiological effect of the inducing agent (i.e. - after a medication or substance is fully out of the individual’s system or the effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely) is sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis, and therefore a bipolar I disorder diagnosis.\n\n##### Specifiers[](#specifiers1)\n\n#### Episode Specifier[](#episode-specifier-1)\n\n*   **Current or most recent episode manic**\n    \n*   **Current or most recent episode hypomanic**\n    \n*   **Current or most recent episode depressed**\n    \n*   **Current or most recent episode unspecified**\n    \n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier-1)\n\n*   **Mild**: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\n    \n*   **Moderate**: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\n    \n*   **Severe**: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n    \n\n#### Remission Specifier[](#remission-specifier-1)\n\n*   **In partial remission**: Symptoms of the immediately previous manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than `2` months without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode following the end of such an episode.\n    \n*   **In full remission**: During the past `2` months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.\n    \n\n*   At least `2` of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or depression:\n    \n    *   (1) Feeling keyed up or tense\n        \n    *   (2) Feeling unusually restless\n        \n    *   (3) Difficulty concentrating because of worry\n        \n    *   (4) Fear that something awful may happen\n        \n    *   (5) Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself\n        \n*   **Severity**:\n    \n    *   **Mild**: `2` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Moderate**: `3` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Moderate-severe**: `4` or `5` symptoms\n        \n    *   **Severe**: `4` or `5` symptoms and with motor agitation\n        \n\n**Note**: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\nThe mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder:\n\n**Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features**:\n\n*   **A**.

Patients often fail (unintentionally) to report hypomanic/manic episodes as well.

This is for two reasons:\n\n*   **Contraception efficacy**: many of the treatments used in bipolar disorder, especially anticonvulsants (such as carbamazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine) can significantly reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCPs), and increase the risk for unintended pregnancy. On the flipside, OCPs can also reduce the efficacy of medications like lamotrigine.\n    \n*   **Teratogenicity**: valproate products (valproic acid, divalproex) have high teratogenic potential and also increase the risk for developmental disorders in infants exposed to valproate _in utero_. Thus, women on valproate products should be on contraception, and informed about the risks of using valproate during pregnancy. Additionally, individuals wishing to become pregnant should work with their clinician to switch off from valproate.\n    \n\n##### Acute Mania[](#acute-mania)\n\n#### Pharmacological Treatments for Acute Mania in Bipolar I[](#pharmacological-treatments-for-acute-mania-in-bipolar-i)\n\nAdapted from: Yatham, L. et al.

Affective instability, with repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts in mood, are considered the core symptoms in borderline personality disorder. Thus, affective instability can be misdiagnosed as hypomania, or vice versa. A [good longitudinal history and interview](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/1-psych-interview \"teaching:1-psych-interview\") can often help differentiate between the two.\n\n#### For Women of Childbearing Age...[](#for-women-of-childbearing-age-1)\n\nContraceptive counselling and medication risks must be included as part of the comprehensive treatment plan for bipolar disorder. This is for two reasons:\n\n*   **Contraception efficacy**: many of the treatments used in bipolar disorder, especially anticonvulsants (such as carbamazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine) can significantly reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCPs), and increase the risk for unintended pregnancy. On the flipside, OCPs can also reduce the efficacy of medications like lamotrigine.\n    \n*   **Teratogenicity**: valproate products (valproic acid, divalproex) have high teratogenic potential and also increase the risk for developmental disorders in infants exposed to valproate _in utero_. Thus, women on valproate products should be on contraception, and informed about the risks of using valproate during pregnancy. Additionally, individuals wishing to become pregnant should work with their clinician to switch off from valproate.\n    \n\n##### Hypomania[](#hypomania)\n\n##### Maintenance[](#maintenance1)\n\n#### Pharmacological Treatments for Maintenance Therapy in Bipolar II (Not Bipolar I!)

Examples include social interactions (e.g. - having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g. - eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g. - giving a speech).\n\nIn children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e. - will be humiliating or embarrassing: will lead to rejection or offend others).\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.\n\nIn children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for `6` months or more.\n\n##### Criterion F[](#criterion-f)\n\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion G[](#criterion-g)\n\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\n\n##### Criterion H[](#criterion-h)\n\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as [panic disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/anxiety/panic \"anxiety:panic\"), [body dysmorphic disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/ocd/body-dysmorphic \"ocd:body-dysmorphic\"), or [autism spectrum disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/asd \"child:asd\").\n\n##### Criterion J[](#criterion-j)\n\nIf another medical condition (e.g. - [Parkinson’s disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/parkinsons \"geri:parkinsons\"), obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.\n\nThough not specifically part of the diagnostic criteria, common physical symptoms of social anxiety disorder include: blushing, stammering, sweating, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry mouth, palpitations, trembling, urgency of micturition, and panic attacks.\n\n#### Performance Specifier[](#performance-specifier)\n\n**Specify if**:\n\n*   **Performance only**: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.\n    \n\n#### Panic Attack Specifier[](#panic-attack-specifier)\n\n**Specify if**:\n\n*   Recurrent _unexpected_ panic attacks. An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time at least `4` of the following symptoms occur (**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state):\n    \n\n1.  Sweating\n    \n2.  Trembling or shaking\n    \n3.  Unsteady, dizziness, light-headed, or faint\n    \n4.  Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from one self)\n    \n5.  Excessive/accelerated heart rate, palpitations, or pounding heart\n    \n6.

Choking feelings\n    \n12.  Chest pain or discomfort\n    \n13.  Chills or heat sensations\n    \n\n**Note**: The symptoms presented in this specifier are for the purpose of identifying a panic attack. However, panic attacks are **not** a mental disorder. Panic attacks can occur in the context of _any_ [anxiety disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/anxiety/home \"anxiety:home\") as well as other mental disorders (e.g. - [depressive disorders](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\"), [posttraumatic stress disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/trauma-and-stressors/ptsd \"trauma-and-stressors:ptsd\"), [substance use disorders](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/home \"addictions:home\")) and some medical conditions (e.g. - cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g. - “social anxiety disorder with panic attacks”). For [panic disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/anxiety/panic \"anxiety:panic\"), the presence of panic attack is contained within the criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.\n\n**Note**: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g. - tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen.

By adulthood, about 20% of sleep is REM sleep. REM sleep continues to decrease into old age. Older adults generally have more insomnia, find it harder to stay up late (due to relative advance of sleep phase), and have more shallow sleep. Sleep disruptions are common, including more brief awakenings. Sleep may also be less restorative, and there may be daytime sleepiness.\n\n [![Sleep Pattern Changes with Age](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png?w=700&tok=34e235 \"Sleep Pattern Changes with Age\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png \"sleep:sleep_changes_with_age.png\") Fig. 1 : Sleep Pattern Changes with Age[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png)\n\nInsomnia is more prevalent in late life and sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Sleep disturbance in older adults is associated with cognitive impairment, poor concentration, and decreased day-to-day functional performance. One of the challenges in identifying sleep disorders in older adults is that sleep architecture naturally changes significantly in healthy older adults ([figure 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/1-introduction/home#img_image2)).

It occurs when normal atonia (muscle paralysis) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep perseverates into wakefulness. Episodes usually last for a few seconds or minutes. Sleep paralysis itself is not harmful, but can be very frightening for patients. In patients with sleep paralysis, a screen for other symptoms of [narcolepsy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/4-narcolepsy \"sleep:4-narcolepsy\") should be done.\n\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used, and are thought to work via suppression of REM sleep. Clomipramine is the first line TCA, followed by imipramine.\n\nHypnagogic (Hypnic) jerks (also known as sleep starts) are a sensation of “falling,” “shock,” or “falling into a void” accompanied by non-periodic myoclonic movements that usually involves isolated body segments.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) They are associated with autonomic activation with transient tachycardia, tachypnea, and motor activity. The causes of hypnagogic jerks are unknown. Theories for their origins include descending volleys within the pyramidal tracts at the transition from wakefulness to sleep.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/2-insomnia-disorder","markdown":"**Insomnia Disorder** is the dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, with complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. Put simply, insomnia is defined as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, _even when a person has the chance to do so_. Insomnia also involves daytime impairments (fatigue and daytime sleepiness). Other changes include cognitive impairment (impacts on attention, concentration, and memory), and mood changes (irritability, mood lability). Insomnia disorder often causes clinically significant distress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. It can occur during the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nA predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with `1` (or more) of the following symptoms:\n\n1.  Difficulty initiating sleep.\n    \n    In children, this may manifest as difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention\n    \n2.  Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep after awakenings.\n    \n    In children, this may manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without caregiver intervention\n    \n3.  Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.\n    \n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioural, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe sleep difficulty occurs at least `3` nights per week.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe sleep difficulty is present for at least `3` months.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.\n\n##### Criterion F[](#criterion-f)\n\nThe insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).\n\n##### Criterion G[](#criterion-g)\n\nThe insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).\n\n##### Criterion H[](#criterion-h)\n\nCoexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the pre-dominant complaint of insomnia.\n\n##### Specifiers[](#specifiers)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **With non-sleep disorder mental comorbidity, including substance use disorders**\n    \n*   **With other medical comorbidity**\n    \n*   **With other sleep disorder**\n    \n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **Episodic**: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.\n    \n*   **Persistent**: Symptoms last 3 months or longer.\n    \n*   **Recurrent**: Two (or more) episodes within the space of 1 year.\n    \n\n#### Types of Insomnia[](#types-of-insomnia-1)\n\n| Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sleep-onset Insomnia (Initial Insomnia) | Difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20-30 minutes. |\n| Sleep Maintenance Insomnia (Middle Insomnia) | Frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout the night. Defined by subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20-30 minutes |\n| Late Insomnia | Early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep. |\n| Early-morning Awakening | Awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. |\n| Non-restorative Sleep | Poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration. This is a common sleep complaint usually occurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in isolation. |\n\n**Behavioural insomnia** is the most common type of insomnia in the pediatric population (i.e. - bedtime problems and/or awakenings, or “bed time resistance”). Children may refuse to sleep, want to be rocked, or sleep in their parents’ bed. This “flocking” behaviour is common in all mammals and a natural protective instinct. Popular methods that demand that children “cry it out” can actually impede development of healthy self-regulation.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) Soothing with an aim toward _learning_ self-soothing provides better long-term results for emotional growth and resilience. Behavioural insomnia should not be treated pharmacologically!\n\nThe 3 principles to treating bedtime resistance are:\n\n1.  Creating an emotional state of calmness and safety\n    \n2.  Consistent limit setting\n    \n3.  Establishing good bedtime habits (i.e. - have a wind-down  period and a sequence of activities that begin 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime, and promote sleep hygiene).\n    \n\nThe onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is more common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or adolescence. Insomnia disorder is considered to be due to hyper-arousal during the day (all-day hyper-vigilance) with difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep during the night. There are several models that attempt to explain insomnia, including: (1) the cognitive model, (2) the physiologic model, and (3) the neuroendocrine model.\n\n##### Chronicity[](#chronicity)\n\nInsomnia can also be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usually lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes in sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event subsides.\n\n### History and Physical[](#history-and-physical)\n\nA detailed evaluation is important to understand the cause and nature of the insomnia, this includes:\n\nMeasuring sleep quality can be done through scales, questionnaires, and sleep diaries:\n\n#### Measurement Scales for Sleep Quality[](#measurement-scales-for-sleep-quality)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) | Patient | The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. | [ESS Information](http://epworthsleepinessscale.com/about-the-ess/ \"http://epworthsleepinessscale.com/about-the-ess/\") |\n| Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) | Patient | The ISI has seven questions rated on a scale of 0 to 4.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) | [ISI Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/2-insomnia-disorder/insomnia-severity-index_isi.pdf \"sleep:2-insomnia-disorder:insomnia-severity-index_isi.pdf (30.7 KB)\") |\n| Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) | Patient | The PSQI is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep quality by measuring 7 components. | [PSQI Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/2-insomnia-disorder/the_pittsburgh_sleep_quality_index_psqi.pdf \"sleep:2-insomnia-disorder:the_pittsburgh_sleep_quality_index_psqi.pdf (151.2 KB)\") |\n\nPolysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g., increased sleep latency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed asleep) and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep. The severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual's clinical presentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often underestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.\n\nQuantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses may indicate that individuals with insomnia have greater high-frequency EEG power relative to good sleepers both around the sleep onset period and during non-rapid eye movement sleep, a feature suggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a lower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objective sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders.\n\nOther laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased arousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., in creased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general, findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive arousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder.\n\nSleep hygiene implementation and sleep education should be a first step for patients reporting insomnia. Basic sleep hygiene alone has not been shown to be effective in treating chronic insomnia, but is important for patient education.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6)[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7) It is important to keep at these habits for at least 2 to 3 weeks before giving up and trying more aggressive interventions such as CBT-I and/or hypnotics. Key sleep hygiene practices include:\n\n1.  **Keep Your Bedroom Cool, and Dark**: A dark room reminds your brain it is nighttime, and a cool room temperature allows your body thermoregulate during sleep.\n    \n2.  **Get Regular Sleep**: Make sure your sleep schedule is regular. Wake up the same time every day and go to sleep the same time every day. This includes the weekdays _and_ weekends.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8)\n    \n3.  **No Napping**: Do not nap at all during the day. This includes lying down! It is important to associate a horizontal body position with sleeping.\n    \n4.  **No Stimulants**: No caffeine or smoking (at least 8 hours before bed)[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n    \n5.  **No Alcohol**: Although individuals may find that it helps them relax and fall asleep easier, alcohol worsens sleep quality, and suppresses REM sleep.[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)[\\[12\\]](#refnotes:1:note12)\n    \n6.  **No Electronics Before Bed**: Do not watch televisions, use your phone, or a computer for at least 1 hour before bed. The blue light stimulates the brain to think it's daytime again.\n    \n7.  **Have A Bedtime Routine**: Set a bedtime routine before going to bed (i.e. - 30 minutes before sleeping, turn off all electronics, listen to soothing music, and read a book in a dim light)\n    \n8.  **Wind Down**: Make sure you are winding down at least 1 hour before bed, and avoid doing stimulating activities\n    \n9.  **Only Sleep When You Are Sleepy**: Do not go to bed until you are actually feeling sleepy\n    \n10.  **Don't Lie Down During the Day:** You want to associate a horizontal body position only with sleeping.\n    \n11.  **Environment**: Make sure the room is quiet, not too bright, and at the right temperature (not too warm or cold)\n    \n12.  **Bed For Sex and Sleep Only**: Do not read books, use your phone, or use a computer on the bed. It is important to associate the bed with sleep (and sex if applicable…) and not any other activities.\n    \n13.  **Don't Look At The Clock**: Avoid the temptation to peek at the clock!\n    \n14.  **Don't Use The Snooze Button**: Snoozing results in short-term gain with long-term (bad) consequences. Snoozing can worsen sleep the day after.\n    \n15.  **Exercise**: Regular exercise can promote good sleep quality.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13) It was previously believed that exercising in the hours leading up to sleep would impair sleep quality, though current evidence suggests this does not make a difference.[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)\n    \n16.  **Keep a Sleep Diary**: A sleep diary can help make sure you know exactly when you sleep and wake up, and help direct the right changes.\n    \n\nRecommended Reading\n\n[![](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0805089586&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=psychdb030f-20&language=en_US)](https://www.amazon.com/Gregg-D-Jacobs/dp/0805089586/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=A7RL1MF9IFOY&dchild=1&keywords=cbt+insomnia&qid=1599594365&sprefix=cbt+insomnia,aps,164&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=psychdb030f-20&linkId=ced55764a10cb402d7dabedf0ec246b1&language=en_US)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2F49DfQ)\n\nPsychDB is an Amazon Associate and earns from qualifying purchases.

Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and have a high sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alertness during the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (or sleep drunkenness).\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\nApproximately 5%-10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with complaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder.

High sensitivity screening questions and a good OCD history includes the following:\n\n1.  **Obsessions**: Do you ever get **_intrusive_** or **_unwanted_** thoughts, images, or impulses that repeatedly enter your mind, despite you trying to get rid of them?\n    \n2.  **Compulsions**: Do you ever feel **_driven_** to do certain things over and over again?\n    \n3.  **Does this waste significant time or cause problems in your life (_Criterion B of DSM-5 criteria_)?**\n    \n\n#### The Relationship Between Obsessions and Compulsions[](#the-relationship-between-obsessions-and-compulsions)\n\n*   Compulsions are usually performed in _response_ to an obsession (e.g. - obsession about contamination → compulsion of hand washing rituals; obsession about a situation being incorrect → compulsion of repeating rituals until it feels “just right”)\n    \n*   For individuals with OCD, compulsions reduce the distress triggered by the obsession, or prevent a feared event from occurring (e.g. - getting sick, hurting someone)\n    \n*   It is important to note that compulsions are _not_ connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g. - arranging items in a certain colour to prevent harm to a loved one) or are significantly excessive (e.g. - washing hands for 30 minutes at a time due to fears of contamination)\n    \n*   Compulsions that are performed are not pleasurable! Rather, they allow the individual to experience relief from their anxiety or distress\n    \n\nObsessions can be external or internal:\n\n#### Common Obsessions[](#common-obsessions)\n\n|     | Descriptions/Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| Contamination | Concerns about dirt, germs, body waste, illness |\n| Symmetry | Needing things “just so”, even, or lined up a certain arbitrary way |\n| Aggressive | Most commonly focused on inadvertent harm, such as being responsible for a fire or break-in; also includes horrific thoughts or images of deliberately harming others, such as stabbing a loved one or pushing a stranger in front of a car |\n| Sexual | Disturbing sexual thoughts that are not consistent with an individual’s orientation or cultural norms, such as someone with a same-sex preference having unpleasant hetero-erotic thoughts, or unwanted inappropriate sexual thoughts about children |\n| Religious | Examples include thoughts about selling one’s soul to the devil, deliberately thinking inappropriate thoughts about major religious figures, or committing mortal sins |\n| Somatic | Exaggerated fears of contracting a serious illness such as hepatitis, or a brain tumour in the absence of any identifiable high risk |\n\nCompulsions can be physical (behavioural) or mental (cognitive):\n\n#### Common Compulsions[](#common-compulsions)\n\n|     | Descriptions/Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| Washing | Excessive hand-washing, showering, or cleaning activities |\n| Checking | Repeatedly turning the stove on and off; re-reading all emails to ensure content is appropriate; driving around the block to ensure didn’t hit someone; asking for repeated reassurance |\n| Ordering | Folding clothes “just so”, or arranging all cans in the cupboard so the labels are facing out |\n| Counting | Performing actions a certain arbitrary number of times, such as tapping each foot 4 times when getting out of bed |\n| Repeating | Repeatedly going up and down the stairs or flushing the toilet; typically done to “cancel” out a bad thought or until it feels “right” |\n\n#### What is the purpose of the compulsion in individuals with OCD?[](#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-compulsion-in-individuals-with-ocd)\n\n*   Prevention seeking: “I want to stop something bad from happening.”\n    \n*   Reassurance seeking: “I need to know the bad thing didn't/will not happen.”\n    \n\n#### Psychometric Scales for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder[](#psychometric-scales-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) | Clinician/Self-report | A checklist and 10-item scale with severity rankings. It is the most widely used rating scale for OCD. Symptoms rated from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) in terms of: time spent, distress, resistance, control, and interference with functioning |     |\n| Florida Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (FOCI) | Patient | A self-rated measure also used in monitoring OCD symptoms |     |\n\nFunctional neuroimaging from PET, fMRI, and SPECT have shown that several brain structures are implicated in OCD:\n\n### PANDAS[](#pandas)\n\nThe differential diagnosis for OCD includes anxiety disorders, depression, complex tics, eating disorders, and psychosis. OCD is considered to be on a spectrum that encompasses comorbid conditions like hoarding disorder, excoriation disorder, trichotillomania disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. All these conditions are generally characterized by specific types of preoccupations and/or repetitive behaviours. It is important that the clinician be aware of all of these related conditions, as they must be differentiated from one another. See also [Criterion D](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/ocd/1-ocd#criterion-d \"ocd:1-ocd\") of the DSM-5 diagnostic criterion.\n\n#### Is it anxiety, psychosis, or OCD?[](#is-it-anxiety-psychosis-or-ocd)\n\nOne of the key features of OCD is that the obsessions/compulsions are egodystonic, meaning the individual does not want these thoughts (it's distressing!). In generalized anxiety, the worries are usually egosyntonic, meaning the individual feels the worries are beneficial to some degree. Similarly, psychosis (specifically delusions) can be confused with OCD. Again, individuals with OCD _usually_ have insight that their symptoms are causing an impairment. Individuals with delusions/psychosis usually lack insight. However, in clinical practice, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the three.[\\[24\\]](#refnotes:1:note24) This is where clinical experience and good history taking comes in! Note also that children generally do not have good insight into their symptoms.[\\[25\\]](#refnotes:1:note25)\n\n#### Is it somatic delusions/illness anxiety disorder or OCD?[](#is-it-somatic-delusions-illness-anxiety-disorder-or-ocd)\n\n*   Individuals with somatic delusions or illness anxiety disorder are convinced that that they have an illness (e.g. - AIDS), despite testing results or medical reassurance.\n    \n    *   The worries in illness anxiety focus solely on health and disease\n        \n    *   The worries are always secondary to a _misinterpretation_ of bodily symptoms, not an intrusive thought\n        \n*   On the contrary, individuals with OCD are preoccupied that they _could_ be infected or are performing excessive rituals to prevent this.\n    \n\n#### Education is Key![](#education-is-key)\n\n*   OCD is a chronic mental disorder that can be difficult to treat.\n    \n*   Thus, whether you are treating with medications or psychotherapy, is it important to set realistic expectations as well as goals of treatment.\n    \n*   Review the nature of the illness with your patient – that OCD is a chronic illness.\n    \n    *   Normalize the symptoms that your patients are experiencing.\n        \n    *   Realistic expectations include acknowledging that the OCD may not be cured, but that the goal is to improve function and reduce impairment.\n        \n*   Those on medications need to understand that there is a lag time between medication initiation and response (up to 3 months).\n    \n*   Those doing therapy need to understand there is an extensive time commitment involved as well.\n    \n\n#### Medications or CBT?[](#medications-or-cbt)\n\n*   CBT is very effective, safer, and more long-acting than medications.\n    \n*   However, it does require motivation and hard work. It may be difficult to do CBT is an individual has comorbidities or is dealing with other major stressors.\n    \n*   CBT may also be difficult to access in certain areas.\n    \n*   Medications are “easy” to take and does help in OCD, but its benefits are limited compared to CBT.\n    \n    *   Additionally, there are side effects of medication to consider.\n        \n    *   Finally, the effects of medications are less enduring, and the risk of relapse is greater.\n        \n\nA specialized form of [CBT](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychotherapy/cbt \"psychotherapy:cbt\"), called Exposure and Response/Ritual Prevention Therapy (ERP) is the gold standard and first-line treatment for OCD, and favoured over medications.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n[![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/amazon_aff/ocd.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3SfhSs3)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3SfhSs3)\n\nPsychDB is an Amazon Associate and earns from qualifying purchases. Thank you for supporting our site!\n\n#### General Pharmacotherapy Principles for OCD[](#general-pharmacotherapy-principles-for-ocd)\n\n*   Treatment is long-term (>1 year is recommended)\n    \n*   Dosage reduction can be considered 3-6 months after that\n    \n*   If 1st line treatment is unsuccessful, at least 2 other medications (SSRI, SNRI, or [clomipramine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/tca/clomipramine \"meds:antidepressants:tca:clomipramine\")) should be tried. Augmentation with a second medication is also another option\n    \n*   Medications can be started at the usual dose and increased q5-7 days\n    \n*   Highest doses work the best, and it may take 6-8 weeks to see the improvements\n    \n*   An “adequate trial” for one medication is between 12-15 weeks, with _at least_ 6 weeks at the maximum dose\n    \n*   Symptoms should always be monitored via a scale like Y-BOCS\n    \n*   When tapering or stopping medications, the taper should be done very slowly. There are high relapse rates unless the taper is combined with behavioural strategies or CBT!\n    \n*   **The focus of treatment should be for improvement in symptoms, and not complete remission**\n    \n\n#### Pharmacotherapy for OCD[](#pharmacotherapy-for-ocd)\n\nKatzman, M.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/4-narcolepsy","markdown":"**Narcolepsy** is a sleep disorder characterized by sleepiness with recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily. Narcolepsy also generally produces _cataplexy_, which most commonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of muscle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Narcolepsy-cataplexy is almost always due to loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin)-producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nRecurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping occurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least `3` times per week over the past `3` months.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe presence of at least `1` of the following:\n\n1.  Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (A) or (B), occurring at least a few times per month:\n    \n2.  Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/lumbar-puncture-lp \"neurology:lumbar-puncture-lp\") hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values obtained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal to `110` pg/mL). Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection.\n    \n3.  Nocturnal sleep [polysomnography](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/polysomnography \"neurology:polysomnography\") showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency less than or equal to `15` minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) showing a mean sleep latency less than or equal to `8` minutes and `two` or more sleep-onset REM periods.\n    \n\n#### Narcolepsy Tetrad[](#narcolepsy-tetrad)\n\nThe classic symptoms of narcolepsy, often referred to as the “tetrad of narcolepsy” are: cataplexy (pathognomonic), [sleep paralysis (essential)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/2-benign-sleep-phenomena#sleep-paralysis \"sleep:2-benign-sleep-phenomena\"), hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\n##### Specifiers[](#specifiers)\n\n#### Specifiers[](#specifiers-1)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency**: Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1 not met).\n    \n*   **Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency**: In this rare subtype (less than 5% of narcolepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of cataplexy and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but CSF hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).\n    \n*   **Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy**: This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mutations and is characterized by late-onset (age 30-40 years) narcolepsy (with low or intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and eventually dementia.\n    \n*   **Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes**: Narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been described in rare cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene.\n    \n*   **Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition**: This sub type is for narcolepsy that develops secondary to medical conditions that cause infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons.\n    \n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **Mild**: Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep.\n    \n*   **Moderate**: Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and need for multiple naps daily.\n    \n*   **Severe**: Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant sleepiness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid dreaming).\n    \n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) criteria for narcolepsy is as follows:\n\nFor Narcolepsy Type 1 (also known as: Hypocretin deficiency syndrome, narcolepsy-cataplexy, narcolepsy with cataplexy), `Criteria A` and `B` must be met:\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a1)\n\nThe patient has daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep occurring for at least `3` months.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b1)\n\nThe presence of `one or both` of the following:\n\n1.  Cataplexy (as defined under Essential Features) _and_ a mean sleep latency of ≤ `8` minutes _and_ `2` or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on an MSLT performed according to standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram may replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT.\n    \n2.  CSF hypocretin-1 concentration, measured by immunoreactivity, is either ≤ 110 pg/mL or <1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay.\n    \n\n#### Notes[](#notes)\n\n*   In young children, narcolepsy may sometimes present as excessively long night sleep or as resumption of previously discontinued daytime napping.\n    \n*   If narcolepsy type 1 is strongly suspected clinically but the MSLT criteria of B1 are not met, a possible strategy is to repeat the MSLT.\n    \n\nFor Narcolepsy Type 2 (also known as: narcolepsy without cataplexy), `Criteria A` to `E` must be met:\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a2)\n\nThe patient has daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep occurring for at least three months.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b2)\n\nA mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes and 2 or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) are found on a MSLT performed according to standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram may replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nCataplexy is absent.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nEither CSF hypocretin-1 concentration has not been measured or CSF hypocretin-1 concentration measured by immunoreactivity is either > 110 pg/mL or > 1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe hypersomnolence and/or MSLT findings are not better explained by other causes such as insufficient sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, or the effect of medication or substances or their withdrawal.\n\n#### Notes[](#notes-1)\n\n*   If cataplexy develops later, then the disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1.\n    \n*   If the CSF Hcrt-1 concentration is tested at a later stage and found to be either ≤ 110 pg/mL or < 1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same assay, then the disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1.\n    \n\n#### Narcolepsy Type 1 vs. Type 2[](#narcolepsy-type-1-vs-type-2-1)\n\n| Type | Narcolepsy Type 1 | Narcolepsy Type 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Formerly called | Narcolepsy with cataplexy | Narcolepsy without cataplexy |\n| Description | People diagnosed with type 1 narcolepsy have an 85% to 95% reduction in the number of neurons that produce orexins.

If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties (e.g. - family members, cleaners, authorities).\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others).\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\n##### Criterion F[](#criterion-f)\n\n#### Specifiers[](#specifiers-1)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **With excessive acquisition**: If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space.\n    \n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **With good or fair insight**: The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic.\n    \n*   **With poor insight**: The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\n    \n*   **With absent insight/delusional beliefs**: The individual is completely convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\n    \n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\n**Animal hoarding** is a special manifestation of hoarding disorder, and is defined as the accumulation of a large number of animals and a failure to provide the minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, starvation, or death) and the environment (e.g. - severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary conditions).[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)\n\n### Children and Adolescents[](#children-and-adolescents)\n\nSince children and adolescents typically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible intervention of third parties (e.g. - parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing interference) should be considered when making the diagnosis of hoarding disorder in this population.[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15)\n\n## Screening and Rating Scales[](#screening-and-rating-scales)\n\n#### Hoarding Scales[](#hoarding-scales)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Saving Inventory-Revised | Clinician/Patient | The Saving Inventory-Revised is a 23-item scale with 3 subscales: Acquiring, Clutter, and Difficulty Discarding.[\\[16\\]](#refnotes:1:note16) The first subscale determines the extent of compulsive buying and acquiring of free things.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-catatonia","markdown":"**Catatonia** is a severe heterogeneous neuropsychiatric and medical syndrome with motor and/or behavioural signs. At times, it can be life-threatening, especially in its malignant form when complicated by fever and autonomic disturbances. Catatonia is not just a psychiatric syndrome and can accompany both psychiatric and medical illnesses.\n\n##### History[](#history)\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nCatatonia can be classified under 1 of 3 categories under the DSM-5:\n\n1.  **Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder** (e.g. - marked psychomotor disturbance in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorder)\n    \n2.  **Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** (e.g. - encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, etc.)\n    \n3.  **Unspecified Catatonia**\n    \n\nOnly Criterion A needs to be met to have a diagnosis of **Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)**\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nThe clinical picture is dominated by at least `3` of the following symptoms:\n\n1.  **Stupor** (i.e. - no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment)\n    \n2.  **Catalepsy** (i.e. - passive induction of a posture held against gravity; or muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli; catalepsy is a motor symptom of schizophrenia similar to waxy flexibility)\n    \n3.  **Waxy flexibility** (i.e. - slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner; the limb can be placed in an awkward posture and remain fixed in position for long time despite asking the individual to relax)\n    \n4.  **Mutism** (i.e. - no, or very little, verbal response \\[exclude if known aphasia\\])\n    \n5.  **Negativism** (i.e. - opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli; see also _Gegenhalten_)\n    \n6.  **Posturing** (i.e. - spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)\n    \n7.  **Mannerism** (i.e. - odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions)\n    \n8.  **Stereotypy** (i.e. - repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)\n    \n9.  **Agitation** (not influenced by external stimuli)\n    \n10.  **Grimacing**\n    \n11.  **Echolalia** (i.e. - mimicking another’s speech)\n    \n12.  **Echopraxia** (i.e. - mimicking another’s movements)\n    \n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**WRENCHES**` can be used to remember the core features of catatonia:\n\n*   `**W**` - Waxy flexibility\n    \n*   `**R**` - Rigidity\n    \n*   `**E**` - Echopraxia\n    \n*   `**N**` - Negativism\n    \n*   `**C**` - Catalepsy\n    \n*   `**H**` - High level of motor activity\n    \n*   `**E**` - Echolalia\n    \n*   `**S**` - Stupor, Stereotypy\n    \n\nCriterion A, B, C, D, and E must **ALL** be met to have a diagnosis of **Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThere is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g. - a manic episode).\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a [delirium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/1-delirium \"cl:1-delirium\").\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n#### Memory Aid[](#memory-aid)\n\nIf you don't like the `WRENCHES` mnemonic, catatonia can also be remembered by breaking it down into the categories of decreased, increased, and abnormal psychomotor activity:\n\n*   **Decreased Behaviours**\n    \n    *   Stupor\n        \n    *   Negativism\n        \n    *   Mutism\n        \n    *   Posturing\n        \n    *   Catalepsy\n        \n*   **Abnormal Behaviours**\n    \n    *   Stereotypy\n        \n    *   Mannerism\n        \n    *   Waxy flexibility\n        \n    *   Echolalia\n        \n    *   Echopraxia\n        \n*   **Increased Behaviours**\n    \n    *   Agitation\n        \n    *   Grimacing\n        \n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\nThree subtypes of catatonia have been categorized: stuporous, excited, and malignant. It should be noted that these subtypes are not recognized in the DSM-5.\n\n1.  **Stuporous catatonia** is characterized by immobility, staring, mutism, rigidity, withdrawal and refusal to eat, along with more bizarre features such as posturing, grimacing, negativism, waxy flexibility, echophenomena, stereotypy, verbigeration, and automatic obedience.\n    \n2.  **Excited catatonia** is characterized by purposeless and excessive motor activity that includes disorganized pressured speech, flight of ideas, verbigeration, disorientation and/or confusion, and confabulation.\n    \n3.  **Malignant catatonia** is accompanied by fever and dysautonomia, and associated with increased morbidity and mortality (up to 10% mortality). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is one form of malignant catatonia. Delirious mania is another form of malignant catatonia, and has features of both excited and malignant catatonia.\n    \n\n## Screening Tools and Scales[](#screening-tools-and-scales)\n\n#### Psychometric Scales for Catatonia[](#psychometric-scales-for-catatonia)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) | Patient | The screening section marks items #1-14 as either “absent” or “present.” The full scale rates items #1-23 on a scale of 0-3. The ratings are made based on the observed behaviors during the examination, with the exception of completing the items for “withdrawal” and “autonomic abnormality,” which may be based upon either observed behaviours and/or chart documentation. Rate items only if well defined. If uncertain, rate the item as “0”.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7) | [Download BFCRS](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychosis/bush-francis_catatonia_rating_scale.pdf \"psychosis:bush-francis_catatonia_rating_scale.pdf (53.3 KB)\") |\n\nSeveral models for the development of catatonia have been proposed, but catatonia remains very poorly understood. The dysfunctional neurotransmitter model proposes that a combination of reduced GABA activity in the frontal cortex, increased N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamatergic activity in the posterior parietal cortex, and dampened dopaminergic action in the basal ganglia is responsible for catatonia.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8) The neural network and circuits model suggests that disruption in the mesoencephalofrontal system (brainstem → basal ganglia → limbic system and cerebral cortex). More recent functional imaging studies have shown activity changes in orbitofrontal, prefrontal, motor cortical, and parietal regions.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n\n##### Medical Illness[](#medical-illness)\n\nA variety of medical conditions may cause catatonia, especially neurological conditions (e.g. - neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis) and metabolic conditions (e.g. - hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, diabetic ketoacidosis). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the etiological medical condition.\n\nPrior to the physical exam, it is important to check the chart for reports from previous 24 hours; check for oral intake, vital signs, any behaviour changes or incidents. A physical examination based on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale can help guide the exam for catatonia:\n\n#### Physical Exam for Catatonia[](#physical-exam-for-catatonia)\n\n| Sign | Exam | Pathological Response |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Posturing | Observe the patient | Patient takes on postures on without any clear purpose |\n| Grimacing | Observe the patient | Grimacing is posturing of muscles of facial expression |\n| Stereotypy | Observe the patient | Excessive repetition of a normally goal-directed behaviour (like buttoning a shirt 30 times an hour) |\n| Mannerisms | Observe the patient | Mannerisms are more purposeless than stereotypy |\n| Verbigeration | Observe the patient | Repeating a certain word or sentence WITHOUT a stimulus |\n| Perseveration | Talk to the patient | Repeating a word or phrase WITH a stimulus (i.e. - repeating something a clinician has said) |\n| Mutism | Observe the patient while trying to engage in conversation | Mute |\n| Grasp reflex | Firmly place two fingers in patient's palm | Tightly grasps your fingers (± even if asked not to) |\n| Opposition (_Gegenhalten_) | Instruct patient to “keep your arm loose”, move patient's arm horizontally back and forth by the wrist, with varying degrees of lighter and heavier force | Automatically resists movement in each direction, matching your strength with each move (i.e. - the more you push the stronger resistance you get) |\n| Negativism | Ask patient to look at you | Turns away |\n| Echopraxia | Scratch your head or nose in an exaggerated way | Copies (±even if asked not to) |\n| Waxy flexibility | Reposition patient's arm into an unusual (but painless) position | Initial resistance, then allows self to be repositioned and holds the pose (e.g. > 1 minute) |\n| Anglepoise (_Mitgehen_) | Say, “Don’t let me raise your arm,” then push patient's arm in different directions with **just** your finger | You can move patient's arm with the lightest touch (“like an anglepoise lamp”) |\n| Automatic obedience | • Reach into your pocket and say: “Stick out your tongue, I need to stick a pin in it”.  <br>• Extend your hand, saying, “Please don’t shake my hand | • Sticks tongue out (Don’t actually poke with a pin!)  <br>• Shakes your hand (± won’t let go) |\n| Ambitendence | • Extend your hand, saying, “Please don’t shake my hand”  <br>• Instruct: “Please walk to the end of the room and back | • Oscillates (e.g. - reaching out then retracting hand repeatedly)  <br>• Takes a step away, then back, then away again |\n\n#### German 101[](#german-101)\n\n*   **_Gegenhalten_** (from German: to resist or hold against) is a form of hypertonia characterized by involuntary variable resistance during a passive movement (i.e. - a movement without effort). It can be elicited moving a patient’s forearm rapidly from a contracted to a stretched position, after instructing the patient not to resist. It is a primitive reflex, absent in adults, but can occur in association with frontal lobe disorders, generalized degenerative diseases, and catatonia. It is different from cogwheel rigidity, a sign of extrapyramidal syymptoms.\n    \n*   **_Mitgehen_** (from German: to take part in)is an extreme form of **_mitmachen_** in which very slight pressure leads to movement in any direction, also called the “anglepoise” effect or “anglepoise lamp sign”.\n    \n    *   In _**mitmachen**_, one's body can be put into any posture, despite instructions given to resist.\n        \n\nResearch on the treatment of catatonia is scarce, but there is overwhelming clinical evidence of the efficacy of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13) Unfortunately, studies on the treatment of catatonia remains limited to mostly open-label studies or case reports.[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15)\n\n#### Recommendations for treatment of catatonia[](#recommendations-for-treatment-of-catatonia)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st line | ECT, lorazepam IV, q6-8 hours x 2-3 days (zolpidem could be considered)[\\[16\\]](#refnotes:1:note16) |\n| 2nd line | Memantine 10mg PO daily, titrate over 3-4 days to 20mg daily  <br>Amantadine 100mg PO daily, titrated over 3-4 days to 600mg (in divided doses)  <br>_(Prescribe the above as monotherapy or in combination with a benzodiazepine)_ |\n| 3rd line | Valproic acid 500-1500mg PO daily  <br>Carbamazepine 300-600mg PO daily  <br>_(May be useful if the catatonia is related to underlying mania)_ |\n| Last line | Aripiprazole 10-30mg PO daily  <br>Olanzapine 2.5-10mg PO daily  <br>Clozapine 200-300mg PO Daily  <br>**There is the potential to worsen catatonia or cause conversion to a malignant catatonia**. |\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Videos[](#videos)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n##### Case Reports[](#case-reports)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Barnes, M.

Remember you need features 1 _AND_ 2, plus 3 _OR_ 4 for an individual to be positive for delirium on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).\n\n1.  `**A**` - **Acute and fluctuating** (a change from baseline, AND a change during the day)\n    \n    *   Is there evidence of an acute change in mental status from the patient’s baseline?\n        \n    *   Did the (abnormal) behaviour fluctuate during the day, that is, tend to come and go, or increase and decrease in severity?\n        \n2.  `**I**` - **Inattention** (difficulty focusing/keeping track, drifting off to sleep, easily distracted)\n    \n    *   Did the patient have difficulty focusing attention, for example, being easily distractible, or having difficulty keeping track of what was being said?\n        \n    *   Can use [cognitive tests](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cognitive-testing \"cognitive-testing\") of attention (forward digit span; backward digit span; months of the years backwards; spelling WORLD backwards; serial 7s)\n        \n3.  `**D**` - **Disorganized thinking** (incoherent, rambling, irrelevant, illogical, circumstantial, vague)\n    \n    *   Was the patient’s thinking disorganized or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from subject to subject?\n        \n4.  `**A**` - **Altered level of consciousness** (lethargic, vigilant, stuporous, drowsy, agitated)\n    \n    *   Overall, how would you rate the patient’s level of consciousness? (alert \\[normal\\], vigilant \\[hyperalert\\], lethargic \\[drowsy, easily aroused\\], stupor \\[difficult to arouse\\], or coma \\[unarousable\\])?\n        \n\nObtaining a good history is key and should be the **first step** when seeing a patient with delirium. Do not rely on just self-report by the patient. Use as many collateral sources as possible, including family, staff, and the chart.\n\nThe following items on history should always be obtained:\n\nBefore even considering pharmacologically managing delirium, always think about what could be _causing_ delirium in the first place! First consider the **non-medical issues** that could cause an altered level of consciousness, including: [pain](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/pain-medicine/home \"pain-medicine:home\"), vision deficits, hearing deficits, hunger, constipation (i.e., fecal loading), or urinary retention. Then consider the medical etiologies below. In geriatric populations, also consider the [geriatric giants](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/1-giants \"geri:1-giants\").\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic-1)\n\nThe mnemonic `**DIMS-R**` can be used to remember the common causes of delirium and provide a structured approach:\n\n*   `**D**` - **Drugs**: Is there a drug intoxication, or conversely, a drug withdrawal? Look for sedating medications, anticholinergic medications, and never forget [alcohol withdrawal](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/alcohol/home \"addictions:alcohol:home\")\n    \n*   `**I**` - **Infections**: Is the genitourinary system, chest, skin/soft-issue, or blood infected? If so, consider CXRs or further infectious work up if needed.\n    \n*   `**M**` - **Metabolic**: Are there any changes to glucose, electrolytes, extended electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, VBG CO2, TSH, or B12 that would reflect endocrinopathies, renal failure, or liver failure?\n    \n*   `**S**` - **Structural**: Think about serious intracranial pathologies like stroke, hemorrhage, seizures, or neoplasms. Neuroimaging ([CT](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/ct-scan \"neurology:ct-scan\"), [MRI](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/mri \"neurology:mri\")) may be required.\n    \n*   `**R**` - **Retention**: Is there fecal impaction or urinary retention? If so, consider abdominal X-rays, palpation, DRE, disimpaction.\n    \n\nA non-exhaustive list of potential causes for delirium include:\n\n#### Common Potential Causes of Delirium[](#common-potential-causes-of-delirium)\n\nGage L. and Hogan D.B.

They’re not delirious. | Delirium evaluation minimally requires assessing attention, orientation, memory, and the thought process, ideally at least once per nursing shift, to capture daily fluctuations in mental status.[\\[45\\]](#refnotes:1:note45) |\n| Delirium always resolves. | Especially in cognitively vulnerable patients, delirium may persist for days or even months after the proximal “causes” have been addressed. |\n| We should expect frail, older patients to get confused at times, especially after receiving pain medication. | Confusion in frail, older patients always requires further assessment. |\n| The goal of a delirium work-up is to find the main cause of delirium. | Delirium etiology is typically multifactorial. |\n| New-onset psychotic symptoms in late life likely represents primary mental illness. | New delusions or hallucinations, particularly nonauditory, in middle age or later deserve evaluation for delirium or another medical cause. |\n| Delirium in patients with dementia is less important because these patients are already confused at baseline. | Patients with dementia deserve even closer monitoring for delirium because of their elevated delirium risk and because delirium superimposed on dementia indicates marked vulnerability. |\n| Delirium treatment should include psychotropic medication. | The role of psychotropic medications in delirium remains unclear. They are best used judiciously, if at all, for specific behaviors or symptoms rather than delirium itself. |\n| The patient is delirious due to a psychiatric cause. | Delirium always has a physiological cause. |\n| It’s often best to let quiet patients rest. | Hypoactive delirium is common and often under-recognized. |\n| Patients become delirious just from being in the intensive care unit. | Delirium in the intensive care unit, as with delirium occurring in any setting, is caused by physiological and pharmacological insults. |\n\n#### Delirium Guidelines[](#delirium-guidelines)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health (CCSMH) | Canada | 2006, 2014 | • [2014 Update](http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-ccsmh-Guideline-Update-Delirium.pdf \"http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-ccsmh-Guideline-Update-Delirium.pdf\")  <br>• [2006 Guideline](http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NatlGuideline_Delirium.pdf \"http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NatlGuideline_Delirium.pdf\")  <br>• [Pocket Card](https://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Delirium-tool-layout-FINAL.pdf \"https://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Delirium-tool-layout-FINAL.pdf\") | [CCSMH Delirium](https://ccsmh.ca/projects/delirium/ \"https://ccsmh.ca/projects/delirium/\") |\n| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) | UK  | 2010, 2019 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg103 \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg103\") |\n| American Geriatrics Society (AGS) | USA | 2015 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901697/ \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901697/\") |\n| Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain, Agitation, and Delirium in Adult Patients in the ICU | USA | 2018 | \\-  | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113379/ \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113379/\") |\n| Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) | USA | 2017 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5717753/ \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5717753/\") |\n| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | USA | 1999, 2004 | \\-  | • [Guideline (1999)](https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium.pdf \"https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium.pdf\")  <br>• [Guideline Watch (2004)](http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium-watch.pdf \"http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium-watch.pdf\")  <br>• [Quick Reference](http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium-guide.pdf \"http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/delirium-guide.pdf\") |\n| Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Delirium in Older People | Australia | 2008 | \\-  | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18713175/ \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18713175/\") |\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n**[5)](#refnotes:1:ref5)** [Ely, E.

As the airway grows and develops during childhood, there is regression of lymphoid tissue and a corresponding reduction in the incidence of OSA.\n\n##### Adults[](#adults)\n\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are obesity and male gender.

Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a subtype of CSA, seen in patients with severe cardiac, neurologic, or renal impairment.\n\nCentral sleep apnea (CSA) is different from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), because in since in CSA, breathing stops because there is no _drive_ to breathe. On the other hand, in OSA, there is _always_ a drive to breath, but that drive is impeded by airway collapse.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nEvidence by polysomnography of `5` or more central apneas for each `1` hour of sleep.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe disorder is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.\n\n##### Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)[](#apnea-hypopnea-index-ahi)\n\n#### Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)[](#apnea-hypopnea-index-ahi-1)\n\n| AHI (events/hours) | Severity |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0-5 | Normal |\n| 5 - 15 | Mild sleep apnea |\n| 15 - 30 | Moderate sleep apnea |\n| \\>30 | Severe sleep apnea |\n\nRemember, 5 apneas within an hour are actually considered within normal range (apnea is > 10 seconds)\n\n#### Specifiers[](#specifiers-1)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   **Idiopathic central sleep apnea:** Characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort but without evidence of airway obstruction.\n    \n*   **Cheyne-Stokes breathing**: A pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five events per hour, accompanied by frequent arousal.\n    \n*   **Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use**: The pathogenesis of this subtype is attributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapnic respiratory drive.\n    \n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier)\n\nSeverity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of the breathing disturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen desaturation and sleep frag mentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.\n\nIn its primary form, CSA is the result of instability of the breathing control system as the individual transitions from wakefulness to sleep. There is increased gain of the ventilatory control system, also referred to as high loop gain, which leads to instability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and can be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or normocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea).\n\nThe onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of heart failure. The Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can promote progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find ing that resolves with time after acute stroke. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older age and male gender.\n\nCSA in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a central sleep apnea breathing pattern called **Cheyne-Stokes breathing** (oscillations between apnea and hyperpnea). This is characterized by periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas (least `5` events per hour that are accompanied by frequent arousals).\n\nPhysical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its risk factors. Findings consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3 heart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present.\n\nPolysonmography is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of each breathing-related sleep disorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are recorded when periods of breathing cessation for longer than 10 seconds occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompanied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end of one central apnea to the end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.\n\n##### Key Questions on Patient History[](#key-questions-on-patient-history)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}

This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood, and adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation.\n\nPulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia, neurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can be the cause of sleep-related hypoventilation. The disorder severity corresponds with increasing severity of blood gas abnormalities.\n\nSleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep disorder.\n\nThe documentation of increased arterial pC02 levels to greater than 55 mmHg during sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pC02 levels (to a level that also exceeds 50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations during sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pC02 have not been adequately validated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults.\n\nProlonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as an indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there are other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/movement/rls","markdown":"**Restless Legs Syndrome** (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom Disorder (WED) is a motor-sensory neurological sleep disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the lower extremities that are accompanied by an almost irresistible urge to move the legs or arms. These uncomfortable experiences are typically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching sensations. Symptoms typically occur at night and are relieved by movement.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\nThe diagnosis of RLS is a clinical diagnosis, and primarily on patient self-report and history. The symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and are associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the legs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness and is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nAn urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized by all of the following:\n\n1.  The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity\n    \n2.  The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by movement.\n    \n3.  The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.\n    \n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe symptoms in Criterion A occur at least `3` times per week and have persisted for at least `3` months.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, peripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a behavioural condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot tapping).\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia).\n\n##### Paediatric Diagnosis[](#paediatric-diagnosis)\n\n#### Paediatric Diagnosis[](#paediatric-diagnosis-1)\n\nDiagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report component. While Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of \"urge to move\" is by the patient, a paediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child's own words rather than by a parent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, adequate descriptors of RLS.\n\nHowever, children rarely use or understand the word \"urge,\" reporting instead that their legs \"have to\" or \"got to\" move. Also, potentially related to prolonged periods of sitting during class, two-thirds of children and adolescents report daytime leg sensations. Thus, for diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal duration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening or night. Nocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of paediatric RLS. As with RLS in adults, there is a significant negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Impairment in children and adolescents is manifested more often in behavioural and educational domains.\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**URGE**` can be used to remember the core features of RLS:\n\n*   `**U**` - **U**rge to move limbs\n    \n*   `**R**` - **R**est worsens the sensation\n    \n*   `**G**` - **G**etting up to move offers temporary relief\n    \n*   `**E**` - **E**vening is worse for symptoms\n    \n\n#### Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) vs. Periodic Limb Movements Disorder (PLMD) vs. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)[](#periodic-limb-movements-plms-vs-periodic-limb-movements-disorder)\n\n*   Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) refers to the symptom, while Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) refers to the sign.\n    \n*   Periodic Limb Movements _Disorder_ (PLMD) is a diagnosis is based on polysomnography findings (i.e. - can only be diagnosed with a sleep study).\n    \n*   Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a clinical diagnosis and does not require a sleep study.\n    \n    *   Up to 90% of individuals diagnosed with RLS have Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) when sleep recordings are taken over multiple nights. Asymptomatic PLMs does not require treatment.\n        \n*   The difference between PLMD and RLS is that PLMD involves an _involuntary_ action. The patient often sleeps through an episode of leg movements in PLMD. In RLS, however, patients are _awake_ the whole time and are jerking or kicking their legs in an effort to overcome the discomfort their brains are perceiving. In summary, RLS keeps the patient awake, but PLMD occurs when the patient is already asleep.\n    \n\nPLMD = PLMs plus sleep dysfunction.\n\nImportant differential diagnoses to consider include:\n\n#### Multiple Diagnoses Can Occur![](#multiple-diagnoses-can-occur)\n\nAlthough it is important to rule out other conditions that could mimic RLS, any of these similar conditions can also _co-occur_ in an individual with RLS.\n\n#### Physical Exam Tips[](#physical-exam-tips)\n\nKnotting of the muscle (i.e. - muscle cramps) on examination, relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness on palpation (myalgia), and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of RLS.\n\n#### Use the Your Clinical Judgment to Help You[](#use-the-your-clinical-judgment-to-help-you)\n\nIn cases where the diagnosis is unclear, asking around PLMs or a family history of RLS can be helpful. Other clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent can also help with the differential diagnosis.\n\n##### Restless Leg vs. Akathisia[](#restless-leg-vs-akathisia)\n\n##### Secondary Causes[](#secondary-causes)\n\nPolysomnography demonstrates significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased latency to sleep, and higher arousal index. Polysomnography with a preceding immobilization test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements, under standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS symptoms.\n\nIf there is iron deficiency, it is reasonable to start with iron supplementation as a first-choice and might be an easy “fix” if the serum ferritin level is <75.\n\nFirst-line treatment for RLS is with dopamine agonists.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\n#### Treatment for RLS[](#treatment-for-rls)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st line (α2δ Subunit Gaba-ergic Agonists) | • [Gabapentin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/gabapentin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:gabapentin\") (300 to 2000 mg PO q evenings )  <br>• [pregabalin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/pregabalin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:pregabalin\") (50 to 450 mg PO daily) |\n| 2nd line (Dopamine agonists) | • Rotigotine (Neupro) patch (1 mg to 4 mg patch/24 hours)  <br>• [Pramipexole](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dopamine-agonists/pramipexole \"meds:dopamine-agonists:pramipexole\") (0.125 to 0.5 mg PO qHS )  <br>_L-dopa should no longer be used due to the high risk for augmentation!_ |\n| 3rd line | **Opioids**:  <br>[Codeine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/opioids/codeine \"meds:opioids:codeine\") (15 to 120 mg PO daily), [Tramadol](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/opioids/tramadol \"meds:opioids:tramadol\") (50 mg to 100 mg PO prn), [methadone](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/opioids/methadone \"meds:opioids:methadone\") (5 to 30 mg PO daily)  <br>**Benzodiazepines**:  <br>[Clonazepam](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/2-clonazepam \"meds:benzos:2-clonazepam\") (0.5 to 3 mg PO daily), [temazepam](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/6-temazepam \"meds:benzos:6-temazepam\") (15 to 30mg PO daily)  <br>**Other treatments**:  <br>[Clonidine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist/clonidine \"meds:alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist:clonidine\"), [baclofen](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/gaba-receptor-agonist/baclofen \"meds:gaba-receptor-agonist:baclofen\"), [carbamazapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/carbamazepine \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:carbamazepine\"), B12, folate |\n\n#### Treating two conditions with one medication[](#treating-two-conditions-with-one-medication)\n\n*   If your patient has chronic pain, then you should treat with GABA-ergic agonists, like [pregabalin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/pregabalin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:pregabalin\")\n    \n*   If your patient has ADHD, then you should treat with clonidine\n    \n\n#### Avoid Using Serotonergic Antidepressants[](#avoid-using-serotonergic-antidepressants)\n\nAlthough treatment of RLS will can reduce depressive symptoms, using serotonergic antidepressants (i.e. - [SRRIs](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/home \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:home\"), [SNRIs](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/snri/home \"meds:antidepressants:snri:home\")) can actually induce or aggravate RLS in some individuals.\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Miyamoto, M., Miyamoto, T., Iwanami, M., Suzuki, K., & Hirata, K.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/home","markdown":"**Parasomnias** (also known as disorders of arousal) are a group of sleep disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physiological events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake transitions.\n\nThe most common parasomnias are the group of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. These conditions serve as a reminder that sleep and wakefulness are not mutually exclusive and that sleep is not necessarily a global, whole-brain phenomenon.\n\nSome key questions can be asked to screen for parasomnias:\n\n1.  Have you ever hurt yourself or your partner while asleep?\n    \n2.  Do you eat or drink without full awareness during the night?\n    \n3.  Do you or your bed partner believe that you move your arms, legs, or body too much or have unusual behaviour during sleep?\n    \n4.

This can be a helpful differentiation point with other diagnoses like nocturnal panic attacks.\n\n### Signs and Symptoms[](#signs-and-symptoms)\n\nDuring an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If the individual awakens after the sleep terror, little or none of the dream, or only fragmentary, single images, are recalled. During a typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in bed screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anxiety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation of the pupils). The individual may be inconsolable and is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or comfort him or her. Sleep terrors are also called “night terrors” or “pavor nocturnus.”\n\nDuring a typical episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread, with a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur, a story-like dream sequence (as in nightmares) is not reported. Most commonly, the individual does not awaken fully, but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next morning. Usually only one episode will occur on any one night. Occasionally several episodes may occur at intervals throughout the night. These events rarely arise during daytime naps.\n\nSedative use, sleep deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions, fatigue, and physical or emotional stress increase the likelihood of episodes. Fever and sleep deprivation can produce an increased frequency of NREM sleep arousal disorders. A family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may occur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwalk. The risk for sleepwalking is further increased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder.\n\nIndividuals with sleep terrors frequently have a positive family history of either sleep terrors or sleepwalking, with as high as a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of the disorder among first-degree biological relatives. Sleep terrors are much more common in monozygotic twins as compared with dizygotic twins. The exact mode of inheritance is unknown.\n\nThere are key differences in the diagnostic criteria between [nightmares](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") and [sleep terrors (night terrors)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\"), and the table below outlines these differences. It is important to remember that night terrors occur during deep non-REM sleep (EEG shows a slow wave sleep pattern). Night terrors are technically not dreams, but more of a sudden reaction of fear that occurs during the transition from one sleep stage to another.\n\n#### Sleep Terrors (Night Terrors) vs. Nightmares[](#sleep-terrors-night-terrors-vs-nightmares)\n\nAdapted from Barton Schmitt, MD (2007)\n\n|     | [Sleep Terrors (Night Terrors)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\") | [Nightmares](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peak age | 1-4 years | 3-12 years |\n| Prevalence | 2% of children | 100% of children |\n| Sleep time | First 2 hours | Last 4 hours |\n| Stage of sleep | Stage 3/4 (slow wave sleep) | REM-related |\n| Movement | Active | Little |\n| Autonomic changes | Extreme | Mild |\n| Recognizes parent | No  | Yes |\n| Can awaken | No  | Yes |\n| Consolable | No  | Yes |\n| Dreams remembered | No  | Yes |\n| Confusion/disorientation | Yes | No  |\n| History of sleep walking | Yes | No  |\n| Difficult to console | Yes | No  |\n| Potential to hurt self/others | Yes | No  |\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nYou can `**REM**`ember events (i.e. - no confusion, no amnesia) in REM parasomnias!\n\n#### Comparison of Parasomnias[](#comparison-of-parasomnias-1)\n\n|     | Parasomnia Type | Stage of Arousal | Time of Night | EEG during event | EMG during event | Unresponsive during event | Autonomic activity | Anmesia | Confusion post-episode | Family history of parasomnias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confusional Arousal | NREM | NREM Stage 2-4 | Anytime | N/A | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleepwalking](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleepwalking \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleepwalking\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | Low | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [Sleep terrors](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/1-nrem-sleep-disorder/sleep-terrors \"sleep:parasomnias:1-nrem-sleep-disorder:sleep-terrors\") | NREM | NREM Stage 3-4 | First 2 hours | Mixed | Low | Yes | High | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| [REM sleep behaviour disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/2-rem-sleep-disorder/home \"sleep:parasomnias:2-rem-sleep-disorder:home\") | REM | REM | Anytime (but more likely later half) | Characteristic of REM | High | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n| [Nightmare disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/parasomnias/nightmare-disorder \"sleep:parasomnias:nightmare-disorder\") | REM | REM | Anytime | N/A | N/A | Yes | High | No  | No (can remember the dreams!) | No  |\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** American Psychiatric Association.

Personality changes (disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression)\n    \n3.  Physical changes (headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus, hyperacusis, photosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic medications)\n    \n4.

In general, TBIs can cause a variety of cytotoxic processes, including axonal injury, free-radical injuries, changes in Mg+2 and Ca+2 signalling, and neurotransmitter excitotoxicity. These changes contribute to a range of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\nIn some instances, the severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be inconsistent with the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g., chronic hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as [somatic symptom disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/somatic/dsm-5/somatic-symptom \"somatic:dsm-5:somatic-symptom\") or [factitious disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/somatic/dsm-5/factitious \"somatic:dsm-5:factitious\") need to be considered. [Posttraumatic stress disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/trauma-and-stressors/ptsd \"trauma-and-stressors:ptsd\") can co-occur with the neurocognitive impairment and have overlapping symptoms (e.g. - difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, aggressive behavioural disinhibition).\n\nBiomarkers for acute concussion have been identified, including ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1).[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14) The FDA has recently approved this for clinical use.\n\nThere are no approved pharmacological treatments for TBI, and use is off-label to address neuropsychiatric symptoms related to the injury.[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15) A variety of medications can be used depending on the symptom.\n\nIf there is no urgent or acute symptoms, do watchful waiting and assess for spontaneous resolution of symptoms first. A “start low and go slow” approach is important as those with TBI have increased sensitivity to to cognitive side effects of psychotropic and neurological medications.\n\n#### Depression[](#depression)\n\n#### Aggression/Agitation[](#aggression-agitation)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Anticonvulsants | [Valproic acid](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/1-valproic-divalproex \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:1-valproic-divalproex\") 600 to 2250mg daily, carbamazepine 400 to 800mg daily |\n| Beta-blockers | [Propranolol](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/non-benzo-anxiolytics/propranolol \"meds:non-benzo-anxiolytics:propranolol\") up to 420mg/daily,[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17) pindolol 60 to 100mg daily |\n| Mood stabilizers | [Lithium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/1-lithium \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:1-lithium\") 900mg daily |\n| Second generation antipsychotics | [Clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\") 300 to 500mg daily, [quetiapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/6-quetiapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:6-quetiapine\") 25 to 300mg daily, [ziprasidone](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/4-ziprasidone \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:4-ziprasidone\") 20 to 80mg daily |\n\n#### Somnolence[](#somnolence)\n\n#### Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Guidelines[](#traumatic-brain-injury-tbi-guidelines)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Evidence-Based Review of Moderate-to-Severe Brain Injury (ERABI) | Canada | 2007 | [Link](https://erabi.ca/guidelines/ \"https://erabi.ca/guidelines/\") | [Link](https://erabi.ca/ \"https://erabi.ca/\") |\n| Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation | Canada | 2017 | [Link](https://braininjuryguidelines.org/modtosevere/guideline-components/recommendations/ \"https://braininjuryguidelines.org/modtosevere/guideline-components/recommendations/\") | [Link](http://www.braininjuryguidelines.org/ \"http://www.braininjuryguidelines.org/\") |\n| British Columbia Medical Journal (BCMJ) | Canada | 2010 | \\-  | [Link](https://bcmj.org/articles/pharmacological-interventions-traumatic-brain-injury \"https://bcmj.org/articles/pharmacological-interventions-traumatic-brain-injury\") |\n| BMJ Open (Systematic Review) | UK  | 2019 | \\-  | [Link](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e029604 \"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e029604\") |\n| PsychiatricTimes (Expert Opinion) | USA | 2019 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/pharmacological-management-psychiatric-aspects-traumatic-brain-injury \"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/pharmacological-management-psychiatric-aspects-traumatic-brain-injury\") |\n| Tele-Rehabilitation Interventions through University-based Medicine for Prevention and Health (TRIUMPH) | USA | 2020 | [Link](https://medicine.uams.edu/pmr/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Guidelines-TBI-Agitation-2020.pdf \"https://medicine.uams.edu/pmr/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Guidelines-TBI-Agitation-2020.pdf\") | \\-  |\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Lauterbach, M.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/thyroid-disorders/hypothyroidism","markdown":"**Hypothyroidism** is a disorder of the endocrine system where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism can be due to various etiologies including Hashimoto thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, and congenital hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can result in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and can also be caused by psychotropic medications such as lithium.\n\nRemember that the thyroid produces tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which are iodine-containing hormones that control the body’s metabolic rate. T3 binds nuclear receptors with greater affinity than T4, and thus is the “active” hormone.\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**7 B's**` can be used to remember the main functions of thyroid hormone:\n\n*   `B`asal metabolic rate\n    \n*   `B`lood sugar (increases glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis)\n    \n*   `B`reak down lipids (increases lipolysis)\n    \n*   `B`rain maturation\n    \n*   `B`one growth (synergism with growth hormone)\n    \n*   `β`\\-adrenergic effects in heart, which increases contractility (this is why β-blockers alleviate adrenergic symptoms in thyrotoxicosis)\n    \n*   Stimulates surfactant synthesis in `B`abies\n    \n\n**Hashimoto thyroiditis** (also known as Hashimoto's Disease) is an autoimmune disorder with antithyroid peroxidase (antimicrosomal) and antithyroglobulin antibodies. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions (i.e. - most Western and affluent nations). On physical exam, individuals may have a moderately enlarged, nontender thyroid.\n\n**Postpartum thyroiditis** is a self-limiting thyroiditis that can last for up to 1 year after delivery. Individuals can go between transient hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Following the self-limited phase, most individuals will return back to a euthyroid state. On physical exam, the thyroid is typically painless and normal in size.\n\n**Congenital hypothyroidism** in the fetus can occur due to antibody-mediated maternal hypothyroidism, and thyroid dysgenesis.\n\nSelf-limited disease often following a viral infection (e.g. - flu). Individuals may be hyperthyroid early in course of illness, followed by hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can remain permanent in about 15% of cases. On physical exam, individuals will have jaw pain, and tender thyroid. ESR may also be elevated.\n\nWhen an individual does not have adequate iodine, the thyroid will progressively enlarge as it tries to keep up with an increased demand for thyroid hormone production. This results in a prominent goiter that develops, and is seen on physical exam. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of thyroid enlargement and goiter worldwide.\n\nLithium decreases production and release of thyroxine (T4) from the thyroid gland. It also interferes with de-iodination of T4 to T3 (tri-iodothyronine). T3 is the metabolically active form of thyroid hormone.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n#### Hypothyroidism vs. Hyperthyroidism[](#hypothyroidism-vs-hyperthyroidism)\n\n|     | [Hypothyroidism](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/thyroid-disorders/hypothyroidism \"cl:thyroid-disorders:hypothyroidism\") | [Hyperthyroidism](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/thyroid-disorders/hyperthyroidism \"cl:thyroid-disorders:hyperthyroidism\") |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Neuropsychiatric | Hypo-activity, lethargy, fatigue, weakness, depressed mood, reflexes (delayed, diminished) | Hyperactivity, restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, fine tremors (due to increased β-adrenergic activity), reflexes (brisk) |\n| Ocular | Periorbital edema | Ophthalmopathy in Graves disease (including periorbital edema, exophthalmos), lid lag/retraction |\n| Metabolic | Cold intolerance, decreased sweating, weight gain (due to lowered basal metabolic rate), hyponatremia (due to decreased free water clearance) | Heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss |\n| Cardiovascular | Bradycardia, dyspnea on exertion (cardiac output) | Tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, arrhythmias (e.g. - atrial fibrillation), chest pain, hypertension |\n| Gastrointestinal | Constipation. decreased appetite | Diarrhea, increased appetite |\n| Dermatologic | Dry cool skin, coarse brittle hair, diffuse alopecia, brittle nails; puffy facies and generalized nonpitting edema (myxedema) | Warm moist skin, fine hair, onycholysis, pretibial myxedema in Graves disease |\n| Reproductive | Abnormal uterine bleeding, decreased libido, infertility | Abnormal uterine bleeding, gynecomastia, decreased libido, infertility |\n| Laboratory Findings | • Elevated TSH  <br>• Decreased free T3 and T4  <br>• Hypercholesterolemia (due to decreased LDL receptor expression) | • Decreased TSH  <br>• Elevated free T3 and T4  <br>• Decreased LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol |\n\n### Articles[](#articles)"}

This article will address basic concepts related to addictions, substance use disorders, and the DSM-5's conceptualization of these disorders.\n\nPhysiological tolerance is best understood using the example of opioids. When the brain is chronically exposed to elevated levels of opiates, two things develop:\n\n1.  **Tolerance**: the need to take more of the same substance to achieve the same effect\n    \n2.  **Dependence**: being susceptible to opioid withdrawal symptoms (you can only develop withdrawal symptoms if you develop tolerance first).[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n    \n\nThe DSM-5 describes 10 classes of drugs for which substance-related disorders can apply: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, “sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics,” stimulants, tobacco, and other (or unknown) substances. These substances are further broken down into two diagnostic groups:\n\n1.  **Substance _use_ disorders**\n    \n2.  **Substance-_induced_ disorders** (includes intoxication, withdrawal, and other substance/medication-induced mental disorders)\n    \n\n**Depressant** intoxication generally cause mood elevation, anxiety, sedation, behavioural disinhibition, and respiratory depression during intoxication. Withdrawal symptoms generally speaking cause anxiety, tremor, seizures, insomnia.\n\n**Stimulant** intoxication and use generally causes mood elevation, decreased appetite or anorexia, psychomotor agitation, insomnia, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms typically include a “post-use crash” that includes symptoms such as depression, fatigue/lethargy, increased appetite, insomnia, and vivid nightmares.\n\n### Hallucinogens and Other[](#hallucinogens-and-other)\n\n**Hallucinogens** are substances that can cause mind and body separation (“dissociative”) effects and visual and/or auditory hallucinations. Of note, hallucinogens such as PCP and LSD do not cause withdrawal symptoms, and hence do not have a DSM-5 diagnosis for withdrawal. Other hallucinogens however, like [MDMA](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/stimulants/mdma \"meds:stimulants:mdma\") (which is officially designated as a hallucinogen in the DSM-5, but in fact has strong stimulant properties) and cannabis, can trigger withdrawal symptoms.\n\nA substance use disorder for any of the above substances is diagnosed when there is a problematic pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least `2` of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:\n\n1.  The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.\n    \n2.  There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control the substance use.\n    \n3.  A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects.\n    \n4.

Stop if more than 3x LFT elevation. Can also cause GI side effects.  <br>• **Contraindications**: opioid use (due to it competitively displacing opioid medications from their binding sites and precipitating withdrawal), hepatitis, liver failure | Particularly effective for those who report a high euphoria immediately after drinking. Naltrexone has a NNT of about 9. |\n| [Acamprosate](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alcohol/acamprosate \"meds:alcohol:acamprosate\") (“Campral”) | • Glutamate antagonist, mimics GABA  <br>• Not entirely understood  <br>• Restores normal balance of neuronal excitation? | • 666mg TID  <br>• 333mg TID if renal impairment | • Diarrhea, anxiety  <br>• **Contraindications**: Severe renal impairment (if GFR < 30)[\\[27\\]](#refnotes:1:note27) | Expensive medication! |\n| [Gabapentin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/gabapentin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:gabapentin\") | • GABA agonist | • 100mg PO BID + 300mg PO qHS x 4 days  <br>• Initial dose 300 mg TID (900mg daily)  <br>• Optimal dose is 600 mg TID (1800 daily)[\\[28\\]](#refnotes:1:note28) | • Low side-effect profile and very well tolerated  <br>• Mild headache, fatigue | • Gabapentin can be started rapidly in patients with chronic alcohol use because they already have a ramped up GABA system, i.e. - high GABA levels  <br>• In chronic alcoholism, there is ++ GABA activation (EtOH is a GABA agonist), therefore, it is OK to start on a higher dose of gabapentin  <br>• However, in mild alcohol use disorder, you must slowly titrate up the dose |\n| [Disulfram](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alcohol/disulfiram \"meds:alcohol:disulfiram\") (“Antabuse”) | • Inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase  <br>• Increases serum acetaldehyde causing toxic symptoms - nausea, tachycardia | • 125mg PO daily, increase to 250mg daily if reports no reaction to  <br>NNT = 9 | • With EtOH: vomiting, flushed face, headache  <br>• Without EtOH: headache, anxiety, garlic-taste, acne, peripheral neuropathy, depressive symptoms  <br>• Can cause severe hypotension and arrhythmias  <br>• To avoid a severe reaction, wait at least 24-48 hours between the last drink and the first drink  <br>• May trigger psychosis at high doses  <br>• **Contraindications**: liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, and unstable cardiovascular disease | Relatively poor evidence for efficacy |\n| [Topiramate](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alcohol/topiramate \"meds:alcohol:topiramate\") | • Alters GABA receptors | • 50mg PO daily; titrate by 50mg to a max of 300mg daily | • Fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, nervousness, numbness in hands/feet | Like most anticonvulsants, there is an associated risk of birth defects.

These include:\n\n1.  Dementia\n    \n2.  Delirium\n    \n3.  Depression\n    \n4.  Incontinence\n    \n5.  Orthostatic Hypotension\n    \n6.  Falls & Dizziness\n    \n7.  Osteoporosis\n    \n8.  Polypharmacy\n    \n9.  Pain in the Elderly\n    \n10.  Failure to Thrive\n    \n11.  Frailty\n    \n12.  Elder Abuse\n    \n\n#### Attend To Your Patient's Needs First![](#attend-to-your-patients-needs-first)\n\nIt is also important to make sure your patient has the appropriate care needs met to prevent them from developing the geriatric giants. These include:\n\n*   Social/recreational needs (community centres, churches, religious groups)\n    \n*   Medication monitoring and compliance (use blister packs and medication reminders)\n    \n*   Adequate nutrition (Meals-on-Wheels)\n    \n*   Assistance with housekeeping, shopping, cooking\n    \n*   Caregiver education and support\n    \n*   Assistance with legal matters\n    \n*   Respite for caregivers\n    \n*   Elder abuse issues\n    \n*   Transportation\n    \n\n**Incontinence** is the involuntary loss of urine in sufficient amount or frequency to constitute a social or health problem. Even though there are aging associated changes in the bladder and the urinary tract which make the elderly person more prone to urinary incontinence, the problem is not and should not be considered as a normal part of ageing.\n\n**Orthostatic hypotension** (postural hypotension) is a major and often hidden cause of falls in the elderly! Orthostatic hypotension is not a specific disease per se, rather, it is a syndrome of abnormal postural blood pressure response due to one or more underlying conditions that can affect the normal autonomic reflex arc. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as an excessive drop in blood pressure seen when changing from a lying/sitting position to assume a standing and upright posture (at least 20 mmHg systolic and/or 10 mmHg diastolic). The etiologies of the hypotension are numerous, including: hypovolemia, medications, CNS diseases, diabetes, and deconditioning.\n\n## Falls and Dizziness[](#falls-and-dizziness)\n\n#### Falls Risk Factors[](#falls-risk-factors)\n\nAdapted from: Public Health Agency of Canada.

Additionally, beta-adrenergic receptor responsiveness is decreased in the elderly.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n**Polypharmacy** is a major health issue for elderly populations. A majority of the elderly (>65 years) take more than 5 medications. Geriatic patients experience major changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that affect how medications work. Polypharmacy can often resulting prescribing cascades ([figure 1](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/1-giants#img_image1)), where a drug is prescribed, an adverse drug event occurs that is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this drug-induced adverse event.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\n [![The Prescribing Cascade.

The NSAID causes hypertension, and the patient is subsequently prescribed a calcium-channel blocker. The CCB causes ankle edema, and a diuretic is prescribed. The diuretic then causes gout, for which allopurinol is prescribed.\n\nPsychotropic medications like antipsychotics can cause CNS depression, anticholinergic side effects, postural hypotension, EPS, metabolic changes, infections (UTI/pneumonia), and QTc prolongation, particularly when used indiscriminately in [behavioural symptoms of dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/1-bpsd \"geri:dementia:1-bpsd\").\n\n#### News Articles[](#news-articles)\n\n**[Beer's List](https://www.guidelinecentral.com/summaries/american-geriatrics-society-2015-updated-beers-criteria-for-potentially-inappropriate-medication-use-in-older-adults/#section-420 \"https://www.guidelinecentral.com/summaries/american-geriatrics-society-2015-updated-beers-criteria-for-potentially-inappropriate-medication-use-in-older-adults/#section-420\")** is a list of medications that should be avoided in the elderly due to the propensity to cause sedation, falls, and anticholinergic side effects. [Benzodiazepines](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/home \"meds:benzos:home\") in particular causes daytime sedation, motor vehicle accidents, falls/fractures, cognitive decline, and physical dependence. Avoid using benzodiazepines if at all possible, and if absolutely needed, use the lowest effective dose, with a goal for reassessment and [taper](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/deprescribe-tapering \"meds:benzos:deprescribe-tapering\"). Short/intermediate acting benzodiazepines should also be used over long-acting ones.\n\n**Pain** increases in incidence and prevalence after age 60. This is because of the accumulative burden of aging-associated illnesses such as osteoarthritis, compression fractures, diabetic neuropathy, and cancer. It is underreported by the elderly. The most common causes of pain is osteoarthritis (close to 50%).\n\n**Osteoporosis** is progressive low bone mass & micro-architectural deterioration that leads to skeletal weakness and an increased risk of bone fracture; specifically it is a Bone Mineral Density (BMD) T-score of 2.5 or less (which is the equivalent of a bone density lower than 648mg/cm2). Osteoporosis can be primary (a combinational of post-menopasual loss of estrogen in females, and/or related to aging losses of osteoblasts seen in both men and women) or secondary to some other disorder (such as osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess, renal failure, liver disease, etc.).\n\n**Frailty** is the clinical presentation of cumulative biologic changes with aging which result in decreased ability to maintain homeostasis and lead to vulnerability to stressors.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) Fragility can be measured via certain clinical scales, such as the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale ([Clinical Frailty Scale](http://camapcanada.ca/Frailtyscale.pdf \"http://camapcanada.ca/Frailtyscale.pdf\")).\n\n#### Rating Scales for Frailty[](#rating-scales-for-frailty)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) | Clinician | An inclusive 9-point scale introduced to summarize the overall level of fitness or frailty of an older adult after they have been evaluated by a health care professional. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/geri/rockwood_cfs.pdf \"geri:rockwood_cfs.pdf (130.5 KB)\") |\n\n**Failure to Thrive** (FTT) is a syndrome of weight loss, decreased appetite, poor nutrition and inactivity, often accompanied by dehydration, depressive symptoms, impaired immune function and low cholesterol. A work up of FTT requires an interdisciplinary and comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Elder abuse** is defined as any action or inaction that threatens the well being of an older person. Abuse can take many forms, but is usually grouped in 4 major categories: (1) physical/sexual abuse, (2) emotional/psychological abuse, (3) financial abuse (this is the most common), (4) neglect.\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [de Wit, K., Mercuri, M., Clayton, N., Mercier, É., Morris, J., Jeanmonod, R., ... & Parpia, S.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/1-bpsd","markdown":"**Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)** will develop in more than 90% of individuals diagnosed with dementia.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, aggression, screaming, restlessness, wandering, depression, and anxiety. Other symptoms include disinhibition, sexual behaviours, apathy, sleep disturbances, and compulsive or repetitive behaviours. BPSD results in impaired quality of life, increased cost of care, rapid cognitive decline, and massive caregiver burden.\n\n##### Prevalence[](#prevalence)\n\nBPSD is extremely common in the community (60%), and in nursing homes (80%). More than 90% of patients with dementia develop BPSD over 5 years, and the majority of cases have serious clinical implications.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n#### Is It Really Agitation?[](#is-it-really-agitation)\n\nBe careful when using the word “agitation” in a clinical context, as this is thrown without understanding the _meaning_ behind it. Agitation is inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is _not judged by an outside observer to result directly from apparent needs or confusion_ of the agitated individual.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) This means you must always need to understand if there were environment triggers or behaviours behind the “agitation.”\n\nBPSD symptoms can be organized into 5 symptom clusters:\n\n1.  **Apathy** (lack of initiative)\n    \n2.  **Psychosis** (delusions, hallucinations)\n    \n3.  **Aggression**/**Agitation** (verbal, physical)\n    \n4.  **Hyperactivity** (pacing, restlessness, disinhibition)\n    \n5.  **Affective** (dysphoria, elation irritability, anxiety)\n    \n\n#### Frequency of BPSD Symptoms in Alzheimer's[](#frequency-of-bpsd-symptoms-in-alzheimers)\n\nAdapted from: Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry (2007)\n\n| Symptoms | Prevalence (%) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Misidentification syndrome | 10-20 |\n| Depression | 10-25 |\n| Hallucinations (visual > auditory)[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) | 20-30 |\n| Paranoid or delusional | 20-30 |\n| Agitation | 30-70 |\n| Wandering | 15-40 |\n| Aggression | 20-40 |\n| Anxiety | \\>50 |\n| Apathy | 15-80 |\n| Circadian rhythm disturbance | 30-80 |\n\n#### Sundowning[](#sundowning)\n\n“Sundowning” is a phenomenon where disruptive behavior from BPSD worsens in the late afternoon.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) It is thought to occur due to alterations in circadian rhythms from neurodegeneration. The reported prevalence of sundowning varies greatly between different clinical settings and various dementia types. It is also important to note that sundowning can also occur in [delirium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/1-delirium \"cl:1-delirium\") as well.\n\nAgitation, disinhibition, and psychosis from BPSD are associated volume reduction and decreased metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, and temporal lobes.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) These are areas of the brain responsible for emotional regulation, self-awareness, and perception. Other cluster symptoms such as [apathy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/apathy \"teaching:apathy\") are more associated with small vessel white matter disease. Importantly, there is no single cause for BPSD, and it is important to go beyond a biological approach. Biopsychosocial and holistic models that explain the causes of BPSD include:\n\n1.  **Unmet Needs Model** (i.e. - the patient is unable to express their needs)\n    \n2.  **Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold Model** (i.e. - ability to deal with stress or stimuli is impaired as the neurodegeneration progresses)\n    \n3.  **Antecedent-Behaviour-Consequence learning theory** ([ABC Model](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/1-bpsd#antecedent-behaviour-and-consequences-abcs \"geri:dementia:1-bpsd\"))\n    \n\nAnytime you see or hear about a patient with “agitation” or “change in behaviour”, you must have a broad differential diagnosis **at all times**! Even if you've known the patient for a long time, if there is some **new** change in behaviour, you also need to make a **new** set of differentials.\n\n#### BPSD Differential Diagnosis[](#bpsd-differential-diagnosis)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Delirium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/1-delirium \"cl:1-delirium\") | Look for acute changes and fluctuations, and do a thorough delirium work up if suspected.

Any urinary symptoms?\n    \n3.  **Beverage**: are they hungry or thirsty? Have they been offered preferred beverages or food?\n    \n4.  **Bottom** (to Top): a visual survey for obvious precipitants of distress and agitation\n    \n\nDepending on the physical exam and patient's symptoms, common investigations may include: CBC, electrolytes, extended electrolytes, urine culture, and imaging (e.g. - chest X-ray).\n\nManaging BPSD requires a thorough assessment, involving multiple sources of information, including a medical history, social history, personal history, and habits. All medications must be reviewed, and its role and indication reassessed. Family and caregivers also need to be interviewed. There also needs to be an adequate physical exam, bloodwork, and urine cultures if appropriate.\n\nNeuropsychiatric scales to assess behaviours and symptoms are critical to ensuring the symptoms are properly tracked and documented, to track changes before and after a treatment plan.

The content of the questions of the NPI and NPI-NH are identical but have been rephrased appropriately for caregivers. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/geri/dementia/npi-nh.pdf \"geri:dementia:npi-nh.pdf (400.1 KB)\") |\n| Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) | Clinician/Caregiver | The NPI-Q is a questionnaire completed by informants. The NPI-Q differs from the standard NPI in several ways. It is given as a 2-page self-administered questionnaire, as opposed to an interview. The NPI-Q is designed to be completed within 5 minutes. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/geri/dementia/npi-q.pdf \"geri:dementia:npi-q.pdf (127.4 KB)\") |\n\nDaily information and measures that should be captured during each visit with a patient with BPSD should include:\n\n1.  The times medications are being administered for BPSD, and what response the individual has had to the medication\n    \n2.  Overall oral (solids and liquids) intake\n    \n3.  Bowel movements and urine output\n    \n4.  Sleep charting or Dementia Observation Charting (DOS)\n    \n5.  Vitals and/or orthostatic vitals\n    \n6.  Pain monitoring (e.g. - with movement or feeding)\n    \n7.  Overall amount of as needed (prn) medication use\n    \n8.  Review of overnight and previous day's behaviours with staff\n    \n\n### Antecedent, Behaviour, and Consequences (ABCs)[](#antecedent-behaviour-and-consequences-abcs)\n\nIt can often be helpful to break down the BPSD into ABC (**A**ntecedent, **B**ehaviour, and **C**onsequences) charting. This helps you identify if there are patterns to the behaviours, and allows the use of behavioural techniques to extinguish some behaviours, **instead of using medications**. The key is to avoid positively reinforcing unwanted behaviours (e.g. - man screams and nurse soothes him, which leads to more screaming to seek soothing in the future) and encourage the reinforcement of alternate behaviours (e.g. - screaming man gets only attention when he is calm). The challenge with implementing these behavioural care plans is that all staff and caregivers have to be involved and follow the plan. Otherwise, intermittent reinforcement increases and _worsens_ the behaviour.\n\n#### Sample ABC Charting[](#sample-abc-charting)\n\n|     | Antecedent | Behaviour | Consequence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| April 20, 8:00 PM | Patient continuously asks to go to bathroom and calls for help | Pulls of undergarment and urinates on floor | Was told not to do this, brought to room, cleaned and changed |\n| April 23, 8:30 PM | Sitting at nursing station | Asks to go to bathroom repeatedly, begins yelling for help | RN engages patient, distracts and becomes quieter, until RN leaves, and the behaviour re-starts |\n| April 27, 8:20 PM | Sitting alone in corner | Calls out “help” repeatedly | Was asked what was wrong and staff spent some time with her until she calmed down, but then it started again |\n\nIn this example, the antecedent is the patient is in situations where she frequently calls out for help and staff are not present. In order to extinguish this behaviour, she should be given more attention when she is calm, to reinforce the alternate behaviour.\n\n#### Dementia Observational System (DOS)[](#dementia-observational-system-dos-1)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dementia Observational System (DOS) | Observer/Clinician | The Dementia Observational System (DOS) is a tool used to assess a person’s behaviour over a 24 hour cycle for up to 7 days to determine the occurrence, frequency, and duration of behaviours of concern. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/geri/dementia/dementia_observational_system_dos_tool.pdf \"geri:dementia:dementia_observational_system_dos_tool.pdf (65.5 KB)\") |\n\nThe **[DICE Approach](https://diceapproach.com/ \"https://diceapproach.com/\") (Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate)** is a model used to evaluate, manage, and treat BPSD, and to minimize the reflexive use of medications such as antipsychotics.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13)[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14) The evidence for non-pharmacological approaches to BPSD is better than the evidence for antipsychotics, and exceedingly better than for other classes of medication.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Describe | Thoroughly describe and accurately characterize the symptoms and the contexts in which they occur. This description should come from a discussion with the caregiver and the person with dementia (if possible). For example, if the behavior is agitation, it's important to determine the actual behaviour) (e.g. - did the patient strike the caregiver during a bath? Was the water too hot? How was the caregiver talking to and approaching the patient? |\n| Investigate | Once the symptoms are clearly described, the clinician then needs to identify, or exclude, possible underlying and modifiable causes. These can include unmet needs (e.g. - fear, insufficient sleep, a need for eyeglasses or hearing aids), or acute medical problems (e.g. - anemia, urinary tract infection, or constipation). Current medications should be evaluated, and blood tests and urinalysis ordered if needed. Poor sleep habits and boredom also should be considered, along with the any caregiver's relationship with the patient, including caregiver stress or depression that could exacerbate the patient's behaviours. |\n| Create | In this step everyone collaborates to create and implement a treatment plan. Treatments can be either non-pharmacologic (behavioural, environmental, or a combination) or pharmacologic. Priority should be given to treating physical problems, such as antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, or discontinuing drugs that cause behavioural side effects. Providers should brainstorm behavioural and environmental approaches with caregivers and other members of the care team, which could include a visiting nurse or occupational therapist. The 5 domains of general strategies include: (1) educating the caregiver; (2) improving communication between the caregiver and patient; (3) creating meaningful activities for the patient; (4) simplifying tasks and establishing structured routines; and (5) ensuring safety and enhancing the environment. |\n| Evaluate | The final step is to evaluate whether the strategies have been implemented and have had the desired effects. Since behaviours fluctuate over the course of dementia, ongoing monitoring is essential: Caregivers can learn triggers for unwanted behaviors and to learn to spot these triggers before the symptoms fully develop. |\n\n**[P.I.E.C.E.S.](https://pieceslearning.com/ \"https://pieceslearning.com/\") (Physical. Intellectual. Emotional. Capabilities. Environment. Social.)** is a non-pharmacological assessment tool used by healthcare professionals to help them determine causes for behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with dementia. In brief, in P.I.E.C.E.S., the key questions to ask are:\n\n1.  What are the priority concerns; is it a change for the Person?\n    \n2.  What are the **RISKS** and possible contributing factors (PIECES)?\n    \n3.  What are the actions?\n    \n\n#### P.I.E.C.E.S.[](#p-i-e-c-e-s)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| P - Physical causes for behaviours | There are a number of possible physical causes that may trigger a behaviour so time is required to eliminate or at least determine which, if any, of the following physical elements might be causing a reaction:<br><br>• Pain (such as arthritis).  <br>• Sensory loss (poor eyesight, poor hearing).  <br>• Difficulty walking.  <br>• Temperature – cold, hot.  <br>• Medication – what are they taking – anything new or anything recently discontinued? |\n| I - Intellectual causes for behaviours | Due to the impact dementia has on the brain, there are intellectual impairments that individuals with dementia deal with that can cause agitation or other behaviours. Healthcare professionals refer to them as the Seven A’s which help explain the frustration a patient faces:<br><br>1\\. **Anosognosia** is the lack of insight or awareness. The person with dementia does not know they have dementia and they believe they are fine. “There’s nothing wrong with me.”  <br>2\\. **Amnesia** is the loss of memories such as facts, experiences or information. The patient may know who they are but has trouble learning new information or forming new memories.  <br>3\\. **Altered Perception** is the inability to recognize themselves – their own reflection. Living in the past – living 25 years in the past becomes their reality.  <br>4\\. **[Aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\")** is a problem with language. There are four kinds: (1) _Expressive_: know what you want to say but can’t say what you mean, (2), _Receptive_: hear the voice or see the print but can’t make sense of the words, (3) _Anomic_: trouble using the correct word for places, object or events, (4) _Global_: can’t speak, understand speech, read or write.  <br>5\\. **[Apathy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/apathy \"teaching:apathy\")** is the absence or suppression of interest or motivation.  <br>6\\. **Agnosia** is the loss of the ability to recognize objects, faces, voices or places, but still have an ability to think, speak and interact with the world normally.  <br>7\\. **[Apraxia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-apraxia \"neurology:approach-apraxia\")** is a motor speech disorder where messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted. The person is unable to move their mouth, lips or tongue to the right place to make sounds correctly even though their muscles are not weak. |\n| E - Emotional causes for behaviours | How is the person feeling in their body? Potential emotional causes for behavioural issues include [anxiety](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/anxiety/home \"anxiety:home\") and [depression](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/mood/1-depression/home \"mood:1-depression:home\").<br><br>Everyone has a baseline level of anxiety they can withstand. For a person with dementia, their perceptual disconnect impacts their threshold for anxiety. Their world can be frightening which heightens their state of anxiety.<br><br>If you imagine that the objects they see are distorted, language doesn’t sound the same, or they may not recognize their own reflection, this altered state can impact their mood which in turn affects their behaviours.<br><br>Anxiety is fueled by the fact that an individual with dementia has no control over their world – they can no longer navigate their time. Instead, they must rely on others to decide their day and schedule their activities for them.<br><br>Behaviour(s) caused by anxiety may include being in a general state of upset or shadowing (following the caregiver around constantly). |\n| C - Capabilities (How they affect behaviour) | Caregivers need to assess what the individual with dementia is and is not capable of doing and then create opportunities for him or her to help themselves. On some level the individual with dementia is aware of their limitations, but if you need to replace some objects with unbreakable ones, make them as safe and ‘adult’ as possible – not childish.<br><br>There is a risk of caregivers doing too much for the person with dementia. Don’t assume they can’t do things for themselves. Tasks may take longer and they may not remember the order of things but they are still able to perform acts such as dressing themselves.<br><br>Create a list with the proper order of garments, put it on the wall, and point to the list so your loved one can follow it and dress themselves. If followed repeatedly, day after day, their “procedural body memory” will take over and your loved one will look for the list to get dressed. It can become a routine, but this requires consistency. |\n| E - Environment (How does their environment affect behaviour?) | Take a fresh look around the environment, and think about the following:  <br>• Eliminate clutter.  <br>• Create clear, open and safe spaces to walk around in and be able to touch things without fear.  <br>• Is it too hot or too cold? Check the room and water temperature.  <br>• Is the room properly lit? Is it too bright, or too dark? Be aware that darkness can create shadows. Shadows can be frightening and may increase falls.  <br>• Too many people or too much noise can cause confusion and anxiety, which can manifest as a behaviour such as shouting or agitation. |\n| S - Social (How does social activity affect behaviour?) | The social aspect is all about the person – who they were. It’s very important. A person with dementia may not be able to express themselves as they once did, but their ‘person’ has not left with the disease.<br><br>The Montessori method for dementia programming can be very effective for working with patients – the method’s philosophy is: We define ourselves by the activities we do. The activities are important, but the ability to have activities that hold meaning for us is very important.<br><br>The challenge is to create opportunities that still have meaning for the person with dementia when their cognitive abilities are compromised. It requires planning, careful observation and thought.<br><br>The most effective interventions are built on ‘who’ the person was. So, the best thing you can do for your loved one with dementia is to create a document that tells other people who your loved one was. It should include the highlights, low moments and difficulties faced throughout their lives. |\n\nNon-pharmacological interventions are a cornerstone of managing BPSD, and must not be forgotten! This includes physical exercises and activity programs,[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15) music therapy, therapeutic touch, bright light therapy, and aromatherapy.[\\[16\\]](#refnotes:1:note16) The challenges with interpreting the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions is they are often small in sample size, have no control groups, and have inadequate randomization. Other times, the interventions may be effective, but not financially feasible. The bottom line is that non-pharmacological treatments work, but there is no “one-size fits all” solution.\n\nAntidepressants and antipsychotic medications are the most common medication classes used for BPSD. However, it is important to remember that not all symptoms of BPSD respond to medications, and a comprehensive non-pharmacological approach must be taken! If there _are_ symptoms that can be targeted and treated pharmacologically, the medications should target the specific symptoms:\n\n3.  **Psychosis**: [antipsychotics](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\") (risperidone), antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)\n    \n4.  **Physical aggression**: antipsychotics (risperidone), memantine, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)\n    \n\n#### Symptoms and likelihood of medication response[](#symptoms-and-likelihood-of-medication-response)\n\n| Usually not responsive to medications | Can be responsive to medications |\n| --- | --- |\n| Simple wandering | Sleep disturbances |\n| Hiding | Anxiety |\n| Hoarding | Dysphoria and depressive symptoms |\n| Vocalizations | Apathy/withdrawal |\n| Inappropriate undressing | Hyperactivity |\n| Inappropriate defecation | Hallucinations |\n| Inappropriate urination | Physical/verbal aggression |\n| Repetitive activities | Sexually inappropriate behaviour |\n\n#### Medication Classes for BPSD and Evidence[](#medication-classes-for-bpsd-and-evidence)\n\n| Medication/Class | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n| Antidepressants | • [Trazodone](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/sari/trazodone \"meds:antidepressants:sari:trazodone\") may help decrease insomnia, but it should be used with caution given the risk for orthostatic hypotension.[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17)  <br>• [Citalopram](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/citalopram \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:citalopram\") (best evidence), [escitalopram](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/escitalopram \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:escitalopram\"), [sertraline](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/sertraline \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:sertraline\"), and trazodone have comparable effects as antipsychotics, in reducing delusions, anxiety, and irritability/lability.[\\[18\\]](#refnotes:1:note18)  <br>• In the elderly, it is particularly important to monitor for hyponatremia, and sodium levels should be drawn within 4 weeks.

Recommendations from the NIA-AA workgroup. Alzheimer's and dementia 7.3 (2011)263-269.\n\n| Criteria for all-cause dementia |\n| --- |\n| **1.** Interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities; and |\n| **2.** Represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing; and |\n| **3.** Are not explained by delirium or major psychiatric disorder; |\n| **4.** Cognitive impairment is detected and diagnosed through a combination of (1) history-taking from the patient and a knowledgeable informant and (2) an objective cognitive assessment, either a “bedside” mental status examination or neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychological testing should be performed when the routine history and bedside mental status examination cannot provide a confident diagnosis. |\n| **5.** The cognitive or behavioural impairment involves a minimum of two of the following domains:<br><br>• Impaired ability to acquire and remember new information (repetitive questions or conversations, misplacing personal belongings, forgetting events or appointments, getting lost on a familiar route).<br><br>• Impaired reasoning and handling of complex tasks, poor judgment (poor understanding of safety risks, inability to manage finances, poor decision-making ability, inability to plan complex or sequential activities).<br><br>• Impaired visuospatial abilities (inability to recognize faces or common objects or to find objects in direct view despite good acuity, inability to operate simple implements, or orient clothing to the body).<br><br>• Impaired language functions (speaking, reading, writing problems - difficulty thinking of common words while speaking, hesitations; speech, spelling, and writing errors).<br><br>• Changes in personality, behaviour, or comportment (uncharacteristic mood fluctuations such as agitation, impaired motivation, initiative, [apathy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/apathy \"teaching:apathy\"), loss of drive, social withdrawal, decreased interest in previous activities, loss of empathy, compulsive or obsessive behaviours, socially unacceptable behaviours). |\n\n#### Probable Alzheimer's[](#probable-alzheimers)\n\n| Core clinical criteria |\n| --- |\n| Meets criteria for dementia described earlier in the text, and in addition, has the following characteristics (A to D): |\n| **A.** Insidious onset. Symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days; |\n| **B.** Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition by report or observation; and |\n| **C.** The initial and most prominent cognitive deficits are evident on history and examination in `1` of the following categories.<br><br>a. _Amnestic presentation_: It is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia. The deficits should include impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information. There should also be evidence of cognitive dysfunction in at least `1` other cognitive domain, as defined earlier in the text.<br><br>b. _Nonamnestic presentations_:  <br>• Language presentation: word-finding deficits, but deficits in other cognitive domains should be present.  <br>• Visuospatial presentation: spatial cognition deficits, including object agnosia, impaired face recognition, simultanagnosia, and alexia. Deficits in other cognitive domains should be present.  <br>• Executive dysfunction: deficits of impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. Deficits in other cognitive domains should be present. |\n| **D.** The diagnosis of probable AD dementia **SHOULD NOT** be applied when there is evidence of:<br><br>a. Substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, defined by a history of a [stroke](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/stroke \"geri:stroke\") temporally related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or the presence of multiple or extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden; or  <br>b. Core features of [dementia with Lewy bodies](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/lewy-body \"geri:dementia:lewy-body\") other than dementia itself; or  <br>c. Prominent features of behavioural variant [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\"); or  <br>d. Prominent features of semantic variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\") or nonfluent/agrammatic variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\"); or  <br>e. Evidence for another concurrent, active neurological disease, or a non-neurological medical comorbidity or use of medication that could have a substantial effect on cognition. |\n\nThis certainty specifier can be used if one of the criteria below are met\n\n|     | Criteria |\n| --- | --- |\n| Probable AD dementia with documented decline | In persons who meet the core clinical criteria for probable AD dementia, documented cognitive decline increases the certainty that the condition represents an active, evolving pathologic process, but it does not specifically increase the certainty that the process is that of AD pathophysiology. Probable AD dementia with documented decline is defined as follows: evidence of progressive cognitive decline on subsequent evaluations based on information from informants and cognitive testing in the context of either formal neuropsychological evaluation or standardized mental status examinations. |\n| Probable AD dementia in a carrier of a causative AD genetic mutation | In persons who meet the core clinical criteria for probable AD dementia, evidence of a causative genetic mutation (in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2), increases the certainty that the condition is caused by AD pathology. The workgroup noted that carriage of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene was not sufficiently specific to be considered in this category. |\n\n|     | Criteria |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atypical course | Atypical course meets the core clinical criteria in terms of the nature of the cognitive deficits for AD dementia, but either has a sudden onset of cognitive impairment or demonstrates insufficient historical detail or objective cognitive documentation of progressive decline, |\n| Etiologically mixed presentation | Etiologically mixed presentation meets all core clinical criteria for AD dementia but has evidence of:  <br>a. concomitant cerebrovascular disease, defined by a history of stroke temporally related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or the presence of multiple or extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden; or  <br>b. features of Dementia with Lewy bodies other than the dementia itself; or  <br>c. evidence for another neurological disease or a non-neurological medical comorbidity or medication use that could have a substantial effect on cognition |\n\nAD can present under different subtypes, primarily:\n\nThe amyloid cascade hypothesis and the tau hypothesis are the two predominant theories behind the pathogenesis of AD. Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are found in post-mortem pathology. The loss of cholinergic neurons in the limbic system is also thought to be a core part of AD pathology.\n\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) is metabolized by alpha-, beta- and gamma- secretase, which generates a small peptide, A-beta (Aβ). Aβ40 and Aβ42 are the two main components of amyloid plaques in AD brains. Aβ42 is more prone to aggregation, and is the main component of the amyloid plaques found AD. As Aβ42 deposits accumulate, this is thought to lead to the formation of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to neuronal cell death, and ultimately dementia.\n\nTau build up (also known as aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein) is another hypothesized mechanism for AD. It is hypothesized to be due to increased activity of tau kinases, which causes the tau protein to misfold and clump, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The tau filaments in AD are called paired helical filaments.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease is broad, as it overlaps with other [neurodegenerative disorders](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/home \"geri:dementia:home\"). In older adults, it is particularly important to rule out primary psychiatric disorders (depression in particular) which can mimic dementia.\n\nThe diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease remains a clinical diagnosis, though neuroimaging and biomarkers are beginning to play a larger role in diagnosis.\n\nCurrent treatments do not alter the course of the disease. Medications only serve to reduce the rate of decline, and symptomatic improvement.\n\nIt is extremely important for education about the illness to be provided to both the patient and their families. Caregiver support is also extremely important as the disease progresses. Better caregiver support and interventions helps delay institutionalization.[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17)\n\n#### Pharmacotherapy for AD[](#pharmacotherapy-for-ad)\n\n| Medication | Type | Starting Dose | Maintenance | Side effects |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Rivastigmine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/rivastigmine \"meds:dementia:rivastigmine\") | Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor | 1.5 mg PO BID | 6 mg PO BID (maximum) | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia. |\n| [Donepezil](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/donepezil \"meds:dementia:donepezil\") | Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor | 5mg PO | 10 mg PO (maximum) | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia.

Half of all mental illnesses begin by age 14 and this increases to more than 75% by the mid-20s.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Neuropsychiatric conditions are the leading cause of disability in children and adolescents around the world. Untreated, these disorders have a major impact on neurodevelopment and education.\n\nIn children and adolescents, it is critical to to distinguish between _symptoms_ of a psychiatric disorder versus _behaviours_ that are normal for the child’s stage of development. For example, does a child have ADHD symptoms or do they have normal distractibility and restlessness? Does an adolescent have OCD symptoms or normal rituals and superstitions?\n\nIt is important to remember that many presentations of “psychiatric” concern are part of normal child development, or due to non-psychiatric reasons such as parent-child relational conflicts, sibling relational problems, or high expressed emotion level within family. In these cases, families would benefit from psychosocial supports such as [family therapy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychotherapy/family \"psychotherapy:family\"), or [parent training](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/disruptive-impulsive/0-parenting \"child:disruptive-impulsive:0-parenting\").\n\n [![Timeline of the emergence of childhood psychiatric disorders by age](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/teaching/core/emergence-childhood-disorders.png?w=900&tok=f07204 \"Timeline of the emergence of childhood psychiatric disorders by age\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/teaching/core/emergence-childhood-disorders.png \"teaching:core:emergence-childhood-disorders.png\") Fig. 1 : Timeline of the emergence of childhood psychiatric disorders by age[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/teaching/core/emergence-childhood-disorders.png)"}

CBD was previously classified as a progressive asymmetric movement disorder characterized by akinesia, rigidity, dystonia, focal myoclonus, ideomotor apraxia, and/or alien-limb phenomena. However, it is increasingly seen as a disorder with cognitive and behavioural disturbances as well. The diagnosis of CBD remain challenging because there is considerable overlap between CBD pathology and other neurodegenerative disorders including [progressive supranuclear palsy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp \"geri:dementia:progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp\") (PSP), [Alzheimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/alzheimers \"geri:dementia:alzheimers\"), and [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\").\n\nSince CBD pathology overlaps with other neurodegenerative disorders, it is helpful to first think of CBD on spectrum of neurodegenerative syndromes. Thus the term **Corticobasal _Syndrome_** (not Corticobasal Degeneration), includes other neurodegenerative disorders such as [progressive supranuclear palsy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp \"geri:dementia:progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp\") (PSP), [Alzheimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/alzheimers \"geri:dementia:alzheimers\"), and [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\") (FTD) pathology.\n\n#### Proposed clinical phenotypes (syndromes) associated with the pathology of corticobasal degeneration[](#proposed-clinical-phenotypes-syndromes-associated-with-the-patho)\n\nArmstrong, Melissa J., et al.

time management.  <br>• Use graphic organizer for long-term projects. |\n| Post-secondary | • Encouraging students to contact the Accessibility/Disability Centres.  <br>• Allow extended time for assignments, especially if numerous assignments are all due at the same time.  <br>• Allow extended time on tests/exams.  <br>• Organizational apps to keep notes, lists, ideas and more e.g. Evernote and Simplenote, Mind Manager.  <br>• Technological support to better organize thinking, taking notes, writing, e.g. Livescribe, AudioNote, One Note, SoundNote, Audiotorium and Screen Record  <br>• Concept Mapping can be achieved on the computer by using graphic organizers (e.g., Inspiration, Writers Companion, Draft Builder).  <br>• Access to preferential seating in lectures (close to the lecturer, away from visual or auditory distractions such as cycling heating/cooling units).  <br>• Access to a scribe or note taker to take notes for those courses where it is necessary to focus on the lecture rather than switching attention between the lecture to ensure lecture notes are adequate and thorough enough to review for tests/exams.  <br>• Obtaining advance copies of lecture notes, overheads, etc. so that the student can focus on the lecture rather than read what's on the board, take notes, and listen all at the same time.  <br>• Use videotape lectures if granted permission and review them later to reinforce class work.  <br>• Devices such as a tablet as well as apps that help with writing such as planning (e.g., Inspiration); drafting (e.g., Dragon Dictation, iPad Dictation); and note-taking (e.g., Notability).  <br>• Work with accessibility/disability staff to review and chunk assignments, check details, assist with time management and due dates and review progress.  <br>• Access to ‘prompt’ sheets/memory aids with outline of steps, formulas etc.  <br>• Coaching to identify strengths, negotiate problems, and work on specific goals. |\n\n### Manualized and Other Interventions[](#manualized-and-other-interventions)\n\nMany types of standardized, or structured behavioural interventions have been investigated, including:\n\n#### What's the Long-term Evidence for Stimulants in ADHD?[](#whats-the-long-term-evidence-for-stimulants-in-adhd)\n\nThe Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or MTA, is the largest long-term follow up study on stimulant treatment for ADHD.[\\[63\\]](#refnotes:1:note63)[\\[64\\]](#refnotes:1:note64) At the 8-year follow up mark, the study drew the following conclusions:\n\n*   _“Although the MTA data provided strong support for the acute reduction of symptoms with intensive medication management, these long-term follow-up data fail to provide support for long-term advantage of medication treatment beyond two years for the majority of children.”_\n    \n*   _“Overall, the findings of this 6- and 8-year follow-up of the children in the MTA indicate that \\[…\\] treatment-related improvements for the children in the MTA are generally maintained, **but differential treatment efficacy continues to be lost at and beyond 36-months**”_\n    \n\nThere remains a paradox and debate about why individuals on long-term treatment on stimulants did not fare better than those who did not. Furthermore, the [NIMH MTA website](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/archive/news/2009/short-term-intensive-treatment-not-likely-to-improve-long-term-outcomes-for-children-with-adhd \"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/archive/news/2009/short-term-intensive-treatment-not-likely-to-improve-long-term-outcomes-for-children-with-adhd\") and [MTA FAQ](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/mta/the-multimodal-treatment-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-study-mtaquestions-and-answers \"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/mta/the-multimodal-treatment-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-study-mtaquestions-and-answers\") also acknowledges the modest benefits of long-term treatment. Other population studies have also suggested this finding as well.[\\[65\\]](#refnotes:1:note65) Finally, at the 16-year follow up of the MTA study, ongoing medication was not associated with reduction of symptom severity, and additionally was associated with height loss of approximately 1-inch.[\\[66\\]](#refnotes:1:note66)\n\nStimulants are considered the mainstay of treatment in ADHD in adolescents and adults, and there are two main classes of medications: [amphetamines](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/stimulants/amphetamine/home \"meds:stimulants:amphetamine:home\") and [methylphenidate](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/stimulants/2-methylphenidate/home \"meds:stimulants:2-methylphenidate:home\") (both classes are available in short, intermediary and long-acting preparations). The average response rate to medications is about 70%.[\\[67\\]](#refnotes:1:note67) The overall response rate in the short-term (i.e. - 12 months) for stimulants is about 90%. Around 40% of individuals will have equal response to methylphenidate and amphetamine, and another 20% each will respond to only one class of medications. On a population level, there is no difference in the efficacy and tolerability between amphetamines and methylphenidate, but individuals may have a better response on one class compared to another.[\\[68\\]](#refnotes:1:note68) While there is considerable data support the short-term benefits of ADHD treatment, there is little evidence that it improves long-term functional outcomes.[\\[69\\]](#refnotes:1:note69)[\\[70\\]](#refnotes:1:note70)[\\[71\\]](#refnotes:1:note71) The general ADHD treatment principles are:[\\[72\\]](#refnotes:1:note72)\n\n1.  Long-acting stimulants are preferred as first-line treatment agents.\n    \n2.  Short- and intermediate-acting stimulants, and non-stimulants (i.e. - [guanfacine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist/guanfacine \"meds:alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist:guanfacine\"), [atomoxetine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/selective-nri/atomoxetine \"meds:antidepressants:selective-nri:atomoxetine\")) are second-line treatment agents, and can be used for patients who experience significant side effects on first-line agents, have had poor response on first-line, or do not have access to first-line medications[\\[73\\]](#refnotes:1:note73)\n    \n3.  Third-line treatments include agents such as [bupropion](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ndri/bupropion \"meds:antidepressants:ndri:bupropion\"), [clonidine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist/clonidine \"meds:alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist:clonidine\"), [imipramine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/tca/imipramine \"meds:antidepressants:tca:imipramine\"), modafinil, and [atypical antipsychotics](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/home \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:home\"). These medications are off-label use, and may be used in adjunct with other first or second line agents. These medications have higher risks, higher side-effect profile, or lower efficacy.\n    \n\n#### It's Not Just About the Meds![](#its-not-just-about-the-meds)\n\nPharmacological treatment for ADHD must be integrated in a multimodal approach (i.e. - a [biopsychosocial](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/biopsychosocial-case-formulation \"teaching:biopsychosocial-case-formulation\") that implements psychoeducation, psychosocial interventions, and manualized interventions), plus a medical evaluation and ongoing follow-up.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal","markdown":"**Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**, also known as **frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)**, or less commonly, Pick's disease, is one of the most common causes of dementia in adults younger than 60 years. FTD is actually an umbrella clinical term that encompasses a group of neurodegenerative diseases (behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, non-fluent variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\"), and semantic-variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\")). Individuals with behavioural variant may have disinhibited behavior, hyperorality, lack of empathy, impaired executive function, and lack of sympathy; Loss of insight is one of the core features of the frontal/behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Those with primary progressive aphasia will have progressive deficits in speech, grammar, word output, semantic knowledge, or naming.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nThe criteria are met for [major](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/2-major-neurocog-disorder \"cl:2-major-neurocog-disorder\") or [mild neurocognitive disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/3-mild-neurocog-disorder \"cl:3-mild-neurocog-disorder\").\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nEither (1) or (2);\n\n1.  **Behavioural variant**\n    \n2.  **Language variant**\n    \n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nRelative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function.\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nThe disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder.\n\n**Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed:\n\n1.  Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing.\n    \n2.  Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging.\n    \n\n**Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed.\n\nIndividuals with behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia may present with apathy or disinhibition. Patients typically lose interest in socialization, self care, and personal responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviours, such as sexual disinhibition. Insight is usually impaired as well. Cognitive impairment is much less prominent during the early stages, and few deficits are found on cognitive testing.\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**BEACH**` can be used to remember the core symptoms of behavioural variant of FTD\n\n*   `**B**` - Behavioural disinhibition\n    \n*   `**E**` - Empathy decrease\n    \n*   `**A**` - Apathy\n    \n*   `**C**` - Compulsions\n    \n*   `**H**` - Hyperorality\n    \n\nThe International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (FTDC) developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of bvFTD in 2011 that are more comprehensive than the  [DSM-5](#).[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n##### I. Neurodegenerative disease[](#i-neurodegenerative-disease)\n\nThe following symptom must be present to meet criteria for bvFTD:\n\n##### II. Possible bvFTD[](#ii-possible-bvftd)\n\n`3` of the following behavioural/cognitive symptoms (A–F) must be present to meet criteria. Ascertainment requires that symptoms be persistent or recurrent, rather than single or rare events.\n\n##### III. Probable bvFTD[](#iii-probable-bvftd)\n\n`All` of the following symptoms (A–C) must be present to meet criteria.\n\n##### IV. Behavioural variant FTD with definite FTLD Pathology[](#iv-behavioural-variant-ftd-with-definite-ftld-pathology)\n\nCriterion A and either criterion B or C must be present to meet criteria.\n\n##### V. Exclusionary criteria for bvFTD[](#v-exclusionary-criteria-for-bvftd)\n\nCriteria A and B must be answered negatively for any bvFTD diagnosis. Criterion C can be positive for possible bvFTD but must be negative for probable bvFTD.\n\n\\* = As a general guideline ‘early’ refers to symptom presentation within the first 3 years\n\nFrontotemporal dementia can be classified into different clinical variants or subtypes:[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\n1.  **Behavioral (or frontal) Variant** (bvFTD) - there is relative preservation of recall, and behaviour is usually the first change\n    \n2.  **Semantic variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\")** (svPPA, or PPA-S), patients have difficulty naming objects, difficulty with single-word comprehension, but speech production is spared along with repetition\n    \n3.  **Non-fluent (agrammatic) variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\") (nfvPPA or PPA-G)**, patients are often stumbling for words and grammar is very poor\n    \n4.  **Logopenic variant [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\") (lvPPA or PPA-L)**, usually rare in FTD, and more commonly seen in Alzheimer's. Patients have impaired naming and repetition, but grammar and single-word comprehension is preserved\n    \n\nA CT head or MRI head can show patterns of atrophy of the frontal lobes that can aid in the clinical diagnosis. Neuroimaging is also helpful to exclude other differential diagnoses such as mass lesions and hydrocephalus.\n\n#### Neuroimaging Findings[](#neuroimaging-findings)\n\n| Variant | Neuroimaging Findings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Behavioral variant | **Both** frontal lobes (in particular the medial frontal lobes) and anterior temporal lobes have atrophy |\n| Semantic variant | Middle, inferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the **left** side usually being more affected |\n| Logopenic variant | Associated with predominantly **left** posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy |\n| Nonfluent variant | Associated with predominantly **left** posterior frontal-insular atrophy |\n\n##### Behavioural Symptoms[](#behavioural-symptoms)\n\n#### Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in FTD or frontal-variant AD[](#do-not-use-acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors-in-ftd-or-frontal-var)\n\nEvidence suggests cholinesterase inhibitors may actually exacerbate behavioural symptoms. This is because unlike in Alzheimer's dementia, cholinergic neurons are relatively preserved in FTD.[\\[20\\]](#refnotes:1:note20)\n\n#### Dementia Guidelines[](#dementia-guidelines)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD) - _Diagnosis and Treatment_ | Canada | 2020 | \\-  | [Link](https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12105 \"https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12105\") |\n| CCCDTD - _Pharmacological Recommendations for Symptomatic Treatment of Dementia_ | Canada | 2012 | \\-  | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24565367/ \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24565367/\") |\n| Deprescribing.org (Bruyère Research Institute) and University of Sydney Deprescribing Guidelines | International | 2018 | \\-  | [Link](https://cdpc.sydney.edu.au/research/medication-management/deprescribing-guidelines/ \"https://cdpc.sydney.edu.au/research/medication-management/deprescribing-guidelines/\") |\n| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) | UK  | 2018 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97 \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97\") |\n| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | USA | 2007, 2014 | \\-  | • [Guideline (2007)](https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimers.pdf \"https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimers.pdf\")  <br>• [Guideline Watch (2014)](https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimerwatch.pdf \"https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimerwatch.pdf\")  <br>• [Quick Reference](https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimers-guide.pdf \"https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/alzheimers-guide.pdf\") |\n\n#### Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) Guidelines[](#behavioural-and-psychological-symptoms-of-dementia-bpsd-guidelin)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| British Columbia Best Practice Guideline for  <br>Accommodating and Managing  <br>BPSD | Canada | 2012 | [Link](https://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2012/bpsd-guideline.pdf \"https://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2012/bpsd-guideline.pdf\") | [Link](http://bcbpsd.ca/ \"http://bcbpsd.ca/\") |\n| Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD) | Canada | 2020 | \\-  | [Link](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12105 \"https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12105\") |\n| Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health (CCSMH) Assessment and Treatment of Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Care | Canada | 2006, 2014 | • [2006 Guideline](http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NatlGuideline_LTC.pdf \"http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NatlGuideline_LTC.pdf\")  <br>• [2014 Update](http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-ccsmh-Guideline-Update-LTC.pdf \"http://ccsmh.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-ccsmh-Guideline-Update-LTC.pdf\") | [Link](https://ccsmh.ca/projects/long-term-care-homes/ \"https://ccsmh.ca/projects/long-term-care-homes/\") |\n| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) | UK  | 2018 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97/chapter/Recommendations#managing-non-cognitive-symptoms \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97/chapter/Recommendations#managing-non-cognitive-symptoms\") |\n| Treatment of Inappropriate  <br>Sexual Behavior in Dementia | UK  | 2016 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4980403/ \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4980403/\") |\n| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | USA | 2016 | \\-  | [Link](https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890426807 \"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890426807\") |\n| Deprescribing.org (Bruyère Research Institute) and University of Sydney Deprescribing Guidelines | International | 2018 | \\-  | [Link](https://cdpc.sydney.edu.au/research/medication-management/deprescribing-guidelines/ \"https://cdpc.sydney.edu.au/research/medication-management/deprescribing-guidelines/\") |\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Clinical Cases[](#clinical-cases)\n\n**[3)](#refnotes:1:ref3)** [Rascovsky, K., Hodges, J.

Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make co-morbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.\n\n#### DSM-IV to  [DSM-5](#) Changes[](#dsm-iv-to-dsm-5-changes)\n\nIndividuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and, when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches. | Inflexibility of behaviour, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviours, markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action. |\n| Requiring substantial support (Level 2) | Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal communication. | Inflexibility of behaviour, difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviours appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action. |\n| Requiring support (Level 1) | Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful. | Inflexibility of behaviour causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence. |\n\nIf there is an accompanying [intellectual impairment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\"), indicate this in the diagnosis. Understanding the intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrum disorder is important for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and nonverbal skill are necessary (e.g. - using untimed nonverbal tests to assess potential strengths in individuals with limited language).\n\nIf there is accompanying [language impairment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/communication/language-disorder \"child:communication:language-disorder\"), the current level of verbal functioning should be recorded (e.g. - “with accompanying language impairment—no intelligible speech” or “with accompanying language impairment—phrase speech”).\n\nRecord “autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition or factor).” This can be a known genetic disorder (e.g. - [Rett syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/rett-syndrome \"child:genetic-disorders:rett-syndrome\"), [Fragile X syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/fragile-x-syndrome-fxs \"child:genetic-disorders:fragile-x-syndrome-fxs\"), [Down syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/down-syndrome-trisomy-21 \"child:genetic-disorders:down-syndrome-trisomy-21\")), a medical disorder (e.g. - [epilepsy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/epilepsy \"cl:epilepsy\")), or a history of environmental exposure (e.g. - valproic acid, fetal alcohol syndrome, low birth weight).\n\nRecord autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of disorder) (e.g. - autism spectrum disorder associated with tic disorder).\n\nIf [catatonia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-catatonia \"cl:0-catatonia\") is present, record separately as “catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.”\n\n## Symptoms and Red Flags[](#symptoms-and-red-flags)\n\nSymptoms of autism are typically recognized during the second year of life (12-24 months of age), and can be reliably diagnosed by age 14 months.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\n#### Red Flags for Autism[](#red-flags-for-autism)\n\nRed flags for autism include:\n\n*   Use of another persons's body as a tool is almost pathognomonic for autism (e.g. - child using parent's hand as a tool to achieve a task)\n    \n*   Seems to be in his/her “own world”\n    \n*   Doesn't respond to own name when called\n    \n*   Doesn’t respond to parent’s attempts to play, even if relaxed\n    \n*   Avoids or ignores other children when they approach or interact\n    \n*   No words by 16 months or no two-word phrases by 24 months\n    \n*   Any loss of previously acquired language or social skills\n    \n*   Doesn’t point to show others things he/she is interested in\n    \n*   Inconsistent or reduced use of eye contact with people outside the family\n    \n*   Rarely smiles when looking at others or does not exchange back and forth warm, joyful expressions\n    \n*   Does not spontaneously use gestures such as waving, reaching or pointing with others\n    \n*   Does not respond to gestures and facial expressions used by others\n    \n*   More interested in looking at objects than at people’s faces\n    \n*   May be content to spend extended periods of time alone\n    \n*   Doesn’t make attempts to get parent’s attention\n    \n*   Doesn’t follow/look when someone is pointing at something\n    \n*   Doesn’t bring a toy or other item to parent to show them\n    \n\n#### Factors That Rule Out Autism[](#factors-that-rule-out-autism)\n\nEvidence of good social and communication skills in childhood rules out a autism spectrum disorder. For example, if parents report the individual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and good nonverbal communication skills throughout childhood, this would rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n## Screening Tools and Rating Scales[](#screening-tools-and-rating-scales)\n\nStandardized behavioural diagnostic instruments with good psychometric properties, including caregiver interviews, questionnaires and clinician observation measures can improve the reliability of diagnosis.\n\nLess than 1 percent of non-syndromic cases of autism are due to mutations in a single gene. The environment (ranging from chemical changes in gene expression, to the absorption of nutrients in the womb) is also thought to play a factor.[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\n#### Autism Guidelines[](#autism-guidelines)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) | Canada | 2014 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/186/7/509 \"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/186/7/509\") |\n| Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) | Canada | 2019 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/authors-auteurs/autism-spectrum-disorder-guidelines-task-force \"https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/authors-auteurs/autism-spectrum-disorder-guidelines-task-force\") |\n| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) | UK  | 2016 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg142 \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg142\") |\n| American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) | USA | 2020 | \\-  | [Link](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/1/e20193447 \"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/1/e20193447\") |\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Rødgaard, E.

It presents primarily as an amnestic dementia and is thought to be due to a TDP-43 proteinopathy in limbic system structures, including the hippocampus.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)"}
{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/attachment/1-theory","markdown":"**Attachment Theory** is a psychological model that states strong emotional and physical attachment to at least one primary caregiver is critical in development during childhood. The theory posits that children are motivated to seek protective contact with caregivers, and if a parent responds sensitively to a child's distress, then the child feels secure enough to explore their environment.\n\n#### What is Attachment?[](#what-is-attachment)\n\nAttachment defined as the particular emotional tie between an infant/child and a specific caregiver – particularly when the child is frightened, upset, tired or ill. In these instances, the child seeks security or comfort from the relationship with that specific caregiver.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\nThe origins of attachment theory start with some key players. Psychiatrist John Bowlby proposed that attachment can be understood within an evolutionary context of how a caregiver provides safety and security for an infant. Attachment is seen as adaptive as it enhances an infant's chance of survival. Around the same time, psychologist Henry Harlow's early social isolation experiments on rhesus monkeys also showed experimental evidence for attachment.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Finally, Mary Ainsworth elaborated on Bowlby's initial work and took an experimental approach to observing a child's attachment to a caregiver.\n\n#### Attachment Theorists[](#attachment-theorists)\n\n|     | Claim to Fame | Consequences of Theory |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Harry Harlow | Studied maternal deprivation, social isolation, and its effects in rhesus monkeys | Reinforced the importance of mother-and-child bonding. Also discovered that physiological needs (warmth, safety, food) alone are not enough, but also emotional needs are required (acceptance, love, affection). |\n| John Bowlby | Coined “attachment behaviour” and founder of attachment theory | A child has an innate need to attach to one main attachment figure (i.e., monotropy, usually the mother). Believed mother-child attachment was an essential medium of human interaction. Attachment had important consequences for later development, personality, and risk of mental illness. Also coined the idea of an “internal working model,” where a child behaves according his representational system of self and other. This model originates from his relationship with his parent. |\n| Mary Ainsworth | The “Strange Situation” experiment | Discovered that the interaction between mother and baby during attachment period significantly influences baby’s current and future behaviour. Maternal sensitivity and responsiveness are the main determinants of secure attachment. |\n\n1.  Infants must have a significant amount of interaction on a regular basis with a caregiver\n    \n2.  Infants must reach the 7 to 9 months mark (cognitive age) for the first signs of attachment behaviour to start occurring\n    \n\n**Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)** are traumatic events that occur during childhood (from age 0 to 17 years), and range from abuse and witnessing violence to growing up in a household with substance and mental health problems. Secure attachment is unlikely to happen in homes where there are multiple ACEs. For example, in a home where a primary caregiver is unavailable (e.g. - incarcerated, intoxicated, mentally ill), attachment between that caregiver and their child simply cannot occur, and insecure attachment is likely to occur.\n\nThe _Strange Situation_ is an experimental procedure devised by Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s to observe attachment between a caregiver and a child. She found that infants typically followed one of four attachment styles.\n\n#### Infant Behaviours in the Strange Situation[](#infant-behaviours-in-the-strange-situation)\n\n| Attachment Style as Child | Expected Behaviour From Caregiver | Description | Corresponding Attachment Style as Adult |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Secure | Expects responsiveness | Explores rooms and toys with interest in pre-separation episodes. Shows signs of missing parent on separation, often crying by second separation. Obvious preference for parents over strangers. Greets parent actively, usually initiating physical contact. Usually some contact-maintaining by second reunion, but then settles and returns to play. | Secure/Autonomous |\n| Insecure (Avoidant) | Expects rebuff (“I don’t want to show you I need you”) | Fails to cry on separation from parent, often continues to play even when left entirely alone. Actively avoids and ignores parent on reunion, i.e., moving away, turning away, or leaning out of arms when picked up. Little or no proximity or contact seeking, no distress, and no display of anger. Response to parent appears unemotional. Focuses on toys or environment throughout procedure. | Dismissive |\n| Insecure (Ambivalent/Resistant) | Expects inconsistency (“I need you!”) | May be wary or distressed even prior to separation, with little exploration. Preoccupied with parent throughout procedure, may seem angry or passive during reunion. Following reunion, fails to settle and take comfort in parent, usually continuing to focus on parent and cry. Fails to return to exploration. | Preoccupied |\n| Disorganized | Expects to be frightened/abused (“I love you, I hate you”) | The infant displays disorganized and/or disoriented behaviours in the parents presence. For example, the infant may freeze with a trance-like expression, may react unusually at parents entrance, may cling while crying hard, and/or leaning away with gaze averted. Infant may otherwise fit to secure, avoidant, or resistant categories. Typically infants will have a frightening or frightened parent and experience an environment that is felt as unpredictable and unsafe. | Unresolved/Disorganized  <br>(“dissociative symptoms”) |\n\nThese attachment styles can also be summarized in terms of the infant's view of self and view of others (see Table below), and reflects on what their attachment style will be when they become adults.\n\n#### Infant Behaviour in the Strange Situation[](#infant-behaviour-in-the-strange-situation)\n\n|     | Positive view of self | Negative view of self |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Positive view of others | **_Secure_**  <br>(Higher self-esteem, higher sociability) | **_Anxious-ambivalent/resistant, insecure_**  <br>(Lower self-esteem, higher sociability) |\n| Negative view of others | **_Anxious-avoidant, insecure_**  <br>(Higher self-esteem, lower sociability) | **_Disorganized/Disoriented_**  <br>(Lower self-esteem, lower sociability) |\n\n#### Attachment and Attunement[](#attachment-and-attunement)\n\nUsing attachment theory can inform how to approach children with attachment difficulties. For example, if a child's attachment style is “anxious” one can respond by being more supportive. Conversely, if a child has a “avoidant” style, one respond by promoting independence. This balanced response to the child's needs is called attunement, or simply put, you are responding to the child’s needs.\n\nThe attachment styles described above carry forward into adulthood. Adults can have one of four attachment styles:\n\n#### Adult Attachment Styles[](#adult-attachment-styles-1)\n\n|     | Description | Summary |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Secure | Maintains appropriate closeness. Seeks out help when needed. | “I'm OK, you're OK” |\n| Dismissive (Self-reliant) | Feels uncomfortable with closeness and deals with stress independently. Will avoid revealing of fear/neediness, and symptoms may be under-reported or suppressed. | “I'm OK, you're not OK” |\n| Preoccupied | Feels uncomfortable being apart. Fears/symptoms may be more exaggerated, and tends to have a greater worry about health. | “I'm not OK, you're OK” |\n| Fearful | Partners and caregivers experience contradictory signals, which can often be confusing and frustrating. | “I'm not OK, you're not OK” |\n\n ![Adult Attachment Styles](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/child/attachment/attachment_styles.png?w=500&tok=e2cc95 \"Adult Attachment Styles\") Fig. 1 : Adult Attachment Styles[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/attachment/1-theory)\n\n### Attachment and Psychiatric Disorders[](#attachment-and-psychiatric-disorders)\n\nWhen children become adults, they develop an internal working model that reflects these underlying attachment styles. Understanding a patient's attachment style when treating them as adults can help healthcare providers understand a patient's approach to healthcare and associated interventions/treatments. When one is ill or has a disease, attachment styles can be activated and play out in the healthcare provider-patient relationship. For example, individuals with anxious/dismissive attachment tend to have poorer health outcomes and treatment adherence, compared to those with secure attachment.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) Being aware of patient's attachment styles as they present in a hospital or inpatient context can be helpful in managing challenging encounters (see Table below).\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n[![](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1487528345&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=psychdb030f-20&language=en_US)](https://www.amazon.com/Damaged-Childhood-Trauma-Illness-Revolution/dp/1487528345?crid=QIBJL44D7SB3&keywords=damaged&qid=1643866600&sprefix=damage%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=psychdb030f-20&linkId=fb8bc0514b762d4379621eb668254138&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3onmNYu)\n\nPsychDB is an Amazon Associate and earns from qualifying purchases.

Provide care on a schedule, to make it reliable and predictable.  <br>• Pre-empt distress by breaking the link that distress is associated with care  <br>• Telling the patient who their primary caregiver is at the start of each shift  <br>• Provide regular check-ins (e.g. - q30 minutes for RN staff), but defer all but urgent care if patient requests help in between check-ins  <br>• This regular check-in allows patients to learn that hospital staff can respond reliably, and become less demanding from this position of reassurance  <br>• Teach patient non-pharmacological coping strategies (e.g. - mindfulness and relaxation techniques) |\n| Fearful/Disorganized | Unpredictable | • Provide usually excellent level of care (capacity for patient to disorganize the team is high)  <br>• Ask patient “what can we do to make you feel safer in this environment?”  <br>• Reduce situations that might increase a patient's sense of threat  <br>• Help the treating team understand the patient's behaviours, and develop empathy for the patient's behaviours  <br>• Reduce the frequency of sudden, unpredictable, or fearful events  <br>• Limit the number of staff involved in the patient's care (whenever possible)  <br>• Collaborate with patient's trusted contacts (e.g. - family doctor) if possible |\n\nThe **Adult Attachment Interview** (AAI) is an important tool in attachment research and clinical use, and uses 20 open-ended questions about an individual's recollection of their own childhood. What is powerful about the AAI is that it is highly effective at predicting how a _child_ of the adult interviewee would be attached to his/her parent (with more than 80 percent predictability).[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) The AAI provides an empirically validated method to follow the transmission of attachment patterns from generation to generation.\n\n#### Attachment Scales[](#attachment-scales)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Adult Attachment Interview** (AAI) | Clinician/Patient | 20 open-ended questions about an individual's recollection of their own childhood | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/child/attachment/adult_attachment_interview_aai_protocol.pdf \"child:attachment:adult_attachment_interview_aai_protocol.pdf (76.5 KB)\") |\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Videos[](#videos)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Herstell, S., Betz, L.

Prominent or persistent memory impairment may not necessarily occur in the early stages but is usually evident with progression. **Deficits on tests of attention, executive function, and visuoperceptual (visuospatial) ability may be especially prominent and occur early**. |\n| Core clinical features | _(The first 3 typically occur early and may persist throughout the course.)_  <br>1\\. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.  <br>2\\. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well formed and detailed.  <br>3\\. REM sleep behavior disorder, which may precede cognitive decline.  <br>4\\. `1` or more spontaneous cardinal features of parkinsonism: these are bradykinesia (defined as slowness of movement and decrement in amplitude or speed), rest tremor, or rigidity. |\n| Supportive clinical features | Severe sensitivity to antipsychotic agents; postural instability; repeated falls; syncope or other transient episodes of unresponsiveness; severe autonomic dysfunction, (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence); hypersomnia; hyposmia; hallucinations in other modalities; systematized delusions; apathy, anxiety, and depression. |\n| Indicative biomarkers | • Reduced dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia demonstrated by [SPECT](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/spect \"neurology:spect\") or [PET](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/pet \"neurology:pet\").  <br>• Abnormal (low uptake) 123iodine-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy.  <br>• [Polysomnographic](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/polysomnography \"neurology:polysomnography\") confirmation of REM sleep without atonia. |\n| Supportive biomarkers | • Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on [CT](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/ct-scan \"neurology:ct-scan\")/[MRI](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/mri \"neurology:mri\") scan.  <br>• Generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion/metabolism scan with reduced occipital activity ± the cingulate island sign on FDG-PET imaging.  <br>• Prominent posterior slow-wave activity on EEG with periodic fluctuations in the pre-alpha/ theta range. |\n\n#### Probable versus Possible Diagnosis[](#probable-versus-possible-diagnosis)\n\n| Probable DLB can be diagnosed if: |\n| --- |\n| a. `2` or more core clinical features of DLB are present, with or without the presence of indicative biomarkers, or<br><br>b.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa","markdown":"**Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)** is a clinically diverse neurological syndrome most commonly associated with [Alzheimer’s Disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/alzheimers \"geri:dementia:alzheimers\") or [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\"). It can also rarely occur in [Parkinson's](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/parkinsons \"geri:parkinsons\")\\-plus disorders. PPA typically begins with gradual, subtle language deficits that progresses to a nearly complete inability to speak.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\nThe age of onset is 50s to early 60s. It affects males and females equally. In terms of incidence within diagnosed dementias, [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\") represents approximately 15% of all dementia cases, and PPA accounts for between 20 to 40% of the these patients.\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\nThe progression of PPA begins with asymptomatic changes in the language centres, followed by early signs of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. The progression of non-amnestic MCI continues, until prominent aphasia is observed.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) The disease further progresses into mutism for most cases. Loss of independence occurs 7 years into the diagnosis in about 50% of cases. The average survival time is 7 to 10 years. After the diagnosis of PPA, patients will typically be diagnosed with a secondary syndrome (e.g. - [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\"), [progressive supranculear palsy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp \"geri:dementia:progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp\"), or [corticobasal degeneration](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/corticobasal-degeneration-cbd \"geri:dementia:corticobasal-degeneration-cbd\")).[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nDevelopmental disability is a risk factor for PPA.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\nThere are three variants of PPA:\n\n1.  **Semantic** (the dominant type and is present in most instances of PPA)\n    \n2.  **Logopenic** (LPA), due to atrophy in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule\n    \n3.  **Non-fluent/agrammatic** (stumbling for words, grammar is very poor)\n    \n\n#### PPA Scales[](#ppa-scales)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Progressive Aphasia Symptom Severity (PASS) | Clinician | The PASS is a clinical instrument used to rate presence and severity of impairment in specific domains of speech and language, as opposed to making a single global language rating. The clinician make ratings on a 5 point scale from “normal” (0) to “questionable/very mild” (0.5), “mild” (1.0), “moderate” (2.0), or “severe” (3.0) impairment.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4) | [Download](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~bradd/PASS.html \"http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~bradd/PASS.html\") |\n\nThe 2011 Criteria proposed by Gorno-Tempini et al are:[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\nFor any PPA subtype, there is `all` of:\n\n1.  [Aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\") is the most prominent feature, and occurs at onset and for initial phase of disease (~2yrs)\n    \n2.  Causes impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs)\n    \n\n#### Exclusion Criteria[](#exclusion-criteria)\n\nAlternative diagnoses should be considered if:\n\n*   If symptoms are better accounted for by other neurodegenerative, medical or psychiatric disorder\n    \n*   If there are prominent initial memory (visual or episodic), visuoperceptual impairments, or behavioural disturbance within the first 2 years of language impairment\n    \n\nIn the **semantic** subtype (also known as **semantic dementia** or **PPA-S**), individuals will have receptive dysfunction and loss of word meaning. There can be prosopagnosia and remote memory loss as well. Speech remains fluent.\n\n**Both** of:\n\n1.  Impaired confrontation naming (i.e. - showing an object or a line drawing of an object (e.g. - a spoon) to a patient and requesting the correct verbal label for that object)\n    \n2.  Impaired single word comprehension\n    \n\nAt least `3` of 4:\n\n1.  Impaired object knowledge\n    \n2.  Surface dyslexia/dysgraphia\n    \n3.  Spared repetition\n    \n4.  Spared speech production\n    \n\n#### Semantic is More Behavioural[](#semantic-is-more-behavioural)\n\nOf the 3 subtypes of PPA, semantic dementia is associated with more behavioural changes.\n\nThe **logopenic variant** (PPA-L or lvPPA) is characterized by impairment in word retrieval with phonological deficits, and impaired repetition.\n\n**Both** of:\n\n1.  Impaired single word retrieval\n    \n2.  Impaired repetition\n    \n\nAt least `3` of 4:\n\n1.  Speech errors in spontaneous speech and naming\n    \n2.  Spared single-word comprehension and object knowledge\n    \n3.  Spared motor speech\n    \n4.  Absence of frank agrammatism\n    \n\n#### Digit Span is Worse[](#digit-span-is-worse)\n\nIndividuals with lvPPA have an impaired phonological loop and are significantly worse on the repetition tasks (even compared to Alzheimer's), on tasks such as on forward and backward digit span.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6)\n\nThe **Non-fluent** subtype (also know as **progressive non-fluent aphasia, PNFA**, or also called **agrammatic variant, PPA-G**) is characterized by distortion of word and sentence construction. This includes abnormal order of words (i.e. - syntax), distortion of word endings, misuse of pronouns, and a lack of grammatical words such as articles (words that define a noun as specific or unspecific, e.g. - _a, an, the_) and prepositions (these are words show the relationship between the noun and pronoun in a sentence, e.g. - _at, for, in, off, on, over, under, into, upon, onto, out of, from within_)\n\nAt least `1` of 2:\n\n1.  Agrammatism\n    \n2.  Apraxia of speech\n    \n\nAt least `2` of 3:\n\n1.  Impaired complex comprehension\n    \n2.  Spared single-word comprehension\n    \n3.  Spared object knowledge\n    \n\n#### Neuroanatomy Findings[](#neuroanatomy-findings)\n\nIn patients with PNFA, there is asymmetric perisylvian and anterior insular atrophy with the dominant language hemisphere most affected (usually the left hemisphere, assuming the individual is right-handed).[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\nDepression, anxiety, and dysphoria are the most common symptoms across all subtypes of PPA.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8) Commonly, patients have also have [apathy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/apathy \"teaching:apathy\"). Changes in eating behaviors are more evident in PPA patients, including hyperorality. Psychotic symptoms in PPA are rare. Disinhibition in patients should make the clinician think of an underlying FTD pathology rather than Alzheimer's pathology for the PPA.\n\n#### PPA subtypes[](#ppa-subtypes)\n\n| Subtype | Semantic (PPA-S) | Logopenic (PPA-L) | Agrammatic (PPA-G) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Other abbreviations or names | • Semantic dementia (SD)  <br>• Semantic variant PPA (svPPA) | • Logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA) | • Non-fluent variant PPA (nfvPPA)  <br>• Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) |\n| Grammar | **N** | **N** | _Imp_ |\n| Repetition | **N** | _Imp_ | _Imp_ |\n| Single word comprehension | _Imp_ | **N** | **N** |\n| Naming | _Imp_ (due to impaired word-retrieval and comprehension) | _Imp_ (due to impaired word-retrieval and anomia) | **N** or _Imp_ |\n| Speech and Fluency | Speech is vague but remains fluent, with circumlocutions and semantic paraphasias | May appear normal during small talk. Word retrieval pauses leads to some degree of loss of fluency. Circumlocution and phonemic paraphasias are common. | Effortful and apraxic, word-finding hesitations. Abnormal order of words, distortion of word endings, misuse of pronouns, and a lack of grammatical words such as (e.g. - _a, the_), or prepositions (e.g. - _at, for, on, into_) |\n| Sample speech | Saying “clock” instead of “watch” when asked to name a wristwatch | Saying “baby flitter” instead of “baby sitter” | Syntax and speech is abnormal, with poor use of tense and modifiers |\n| Neuroimaging | Atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe | Atrophy in posterior temporoparietal part of language network | Atrophy in left inferior frontal gyrus |\n| Common Pathology | FTD with TDP-43 type C (80-90% cases) | Alzheimer's | FTD with tauopathy (60% of cases) |\n| Rarer Pathology | Alzheimer's | • FTD with TDP-43 type A  <br>• FTD with tau | • FTD with TDP-43 type A  <br>• Alzheimer's |\n| Clinical progression | Cases may progress into symptoms characteristic of behavioural-variant [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\") | There is typically a mix of aphasia, and memory difficulties, characteristic of the predominant Alzhemier's pathology. | Parkinsonism most commonly occurs in the non-fluent subtype, with a [corticobasal](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/corticobasal-degeneration-cbd \"geri:dementia:corticobasal-degeneration-cbd\") or [progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp \"geri:dementia:progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp\") etiology being the most likely. In both cases, the underlying pathology is a tauopathy.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9) |\n\nThe vast majority of PPA cases are sporadic. Of the genes that have been identified, there is variability in transmission of these genes. Risk factor genes include GRN (granulin), MAPT (tau), C9ORF72 (protein C9orf72), and PSEN1 (presenilin1).\n\nSince PPA is a syndromic diagnosis, its' pathophysiological etiology can be divided into one of two underlying pathophysiological processes:[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\nFor each PPA subtype, the most common neuropathologies are:[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)\n\nSince PPA has disproportionate language impairment compared to other dementias, cognitive testing scores (especially on language-sensitive tests such as the [Montreal Cognitive Assessment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cognitive-testing/moca \"cognitive-testing:moca\")) can appear significantly worse compared to the patient's actual functional ability and stage of dementia.\n\nAll current medications for PPA are off-label treatments. There are no treatments that can stop or alter the course of disease.\n\nTreatment of [behavioural and psychological symptoms](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/1-bpsd \"geri:dementia:1-bpsd\") for PPA (due to bvFTD) include:\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Kertesz, A., McMonagle, P., Blair, M., Davidson, W., & Munoz, D.

These deficits will be apparent in spoken communication, written communication, or sign language. These deficits can either be in receptive and/or expressive skills.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\nLanguage disorder occurs early in the developmental period. However, there is great variation in early vocabulary acquisition between individuals up until age 4, making the diagnosis unreliable. However, by 4 years of age, individual differences in language ability stabilize, and deficits by this age are highly predictive for future outcomes in adulthood. Individuals with a family history of language disorders are more likely to develop this disorder.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n#### Language Requires Both Receptive and Expressive Skills[](#language-requires-both-receptive-and-expressive-skills)\n\nLanguage requires both receptive (receiving and understanding language) and expressive (production of language) skills. Thus in assessing for a language disorder, both receptive and expressive skills need to be assessed (i.e. - an individual's expressive skills might be significantly impaired, but receptive language skills might be normal). _Expressive_ ability refers to the production of vocal, gestural, or verbal signals. _Receptive_ ability refers to the process of receiving and understanding language messages.\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nPersistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e. - spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or production that include the following:\n\n1.  **Reduced vocabulary** (word knowledge and use)\n    \n2.  **Limited sentence structure** (ability to put words and word endings together to form sentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology)\n    \n3.  **Impairments in discourse** (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).\n    \n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nLanguage abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nOnset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\") or [global developmental delay](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability#global-developmental-delay \"child:intellectual-disability\").\n\nThe etiology of a language disorder can either be developmental (develops at birth), or acquired (through hearing loss, neurological disorders, intellectual disability, [autism spectrum disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/asd \"child:asd\"), or substance abuse).\n\nSpeech and language therapy is the main treatment.

Dementia defined by cognitive decline from a previously higher level of functioning and manifested by impairment of memory and of two or more cognitive domains (orientation, attention, language, visuospatial functions, executive functions, motor control, and praxis), preferable established by clinical examination and documented by neuropsychological testing; deficits should be severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living not due to physical effects of stroke alone.\n    \n2.  Cerebrovascular disease, defined by the presence of focal signs on neurologic examination, such as hemiparesis, lower facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit, hemianopia, and dysarthria consistent with stroke (with or without history of stroke), and evidence of nof relevant CVD by brain imaging (CT or MRI) including multiple large vessel infarcts or a single strategically placed infarct (angular gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain, or PCA or ACA territories), as well as multiple basal ganglia and white matter lacunes, or extensive periventricular white matter lesions, or combinations thereof.\n    \n3.  A relationship between the above two disorders, manifested or inferred by the presence of one or more of the following: (a) onset of dementia within `3` months following a recognized stroke; (b) abrupt deterioration in cognitive functions; or fluctuating, stepwise progression of cognitive deficits.\n    \n\n#### Exclusion Criteria[](#exclusion-criteria)\n\n**Exclusion criteria**: cases with disturbance of consciousness, delirium, psychosis, severe aphasia, or major sensorimotor impairment precluding neuropsychological testing. Also excluded are systemic disorders or other brain diseases (such as[Alzheimer's](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/alzheimers \"geri:dementia:alzheimers\")) that in and of themselves could account for deficits in memory and cognition.\n\n##### II[](#ii)\n\nClinical features consistent with the diagnosis of probable vascular dementia include the following:\n\n##### III[](#iii)\n\nFeatures that make the diagnosis of vascular dementia uncertain or unlikely include:\n\n##### IV[](#iv)\n\nClinical diagnosis of possible vascular dementia may be made in the presence of dementia (section I-1) with focal neurologic signs in patients in whom brain imaging studies to confirm definite CVD are missing; or in the absence of clear temporal relationship between dementia and stroke; or in patients with subtle onset and variable course (plateau or improvement) of cognitive deficits and evidence of relevant CVD.\n\n##### V[](#v)\n\nCriteria for diagnosis of definite vascular dementia are:\n\n##### VI[](#vi)\n\nClassification of vascular dementia for research purposes may be made on the basis of clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic features, for subcategories or defined conditions such as cortical vascular dementia, subcortical vascular dementia, BD, and thalamic dementia.\n\nThe term “AD with CVD” should be reserved to classify patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for possible AD and who also present clinical or brain imaging evidence of relevant CVD. Traditionally, these patients have been included with VaD in epidemiologic studies. The term “mixed dementia,” used hitherto, should be avoided.\n\nThe Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS) Criteria were established in 2017, and proposed a detailed set of criteria to define vascular cognitive impairment.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\n#### Post-stroke dementia (VICCCS Criteria)[](#post-stroke-dementia-vicccs-criteria)\n\nSkrobot, O. A. et al. (2017). The vascular impairment of cognition classification consensus study.

The patient may exhibit immediate and/or delayed cognitive decline that begins after, but within `6` months, of stroke, that does not recover. PSD results from different vascular causes and changes in brain. It includes cases with multiple corticosubcortical infarcts, strategic infarcts, subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, and various forms of neurodegenerative pathology, including AD, which develop within `6` months of stroke\\*. This temporal basis for cognitive decline after stroke differentiates PSD from other forms of major VCI (VaD).\n\n#### Mixed dementias (VICCCS Criteria)[](#mixed-dementias-vicccs-criteria)\n\nSkrobot, O.

It is recommended that a patient is referred to as having “VCI‐AD”, according to the phenotypes present, rather than less specific mixed dementia, for example. Where discrimination is possible, the order of terms should reflect the relative contribution of the underlying pathology, that is AD‐VCI or VCI‐AD.\n\n#### Post-stroke dementia (VICCCS Criteria)[](#post-stroke-dementia-vicccs-criteria-1)\n\nSkrobot, O.

Lacunar infarct and ischemic white matter lesions are the main type of brain lesions, which are primarily located subcortically. It incorporates the overlapping clinical entities of Binswanger's disease and the lacunar state.‡\n\n#### Multi‐infarct dementia (VICCCS Criteria)[](#multi‐infarct-dementia-vicccs-criteria)\n\nSkrobot, O. A. et al. (2017). The vascular impairment of cognition classification consensus study.

These disorders may first present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, and patients may see a psychiatrist before any other specialist. A differential diagnosis for Parkinson's includes:\n\n#### Atypical Parkinson's[](#atypical-parkinsons)\n\nDon't forget that there are atypical features in some Parkinson's patients, including:\n\n*   Symmetry at on set\n    \n*   Lack of resting tremor\n    \n*   Dysautonomia such as urinary symptoms, retention, and erectile dysfunction\n    \n*   Poor response to levodopa (some patients may need to hit 900mg/day of [carbidopa/levodopa](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dopamine-agonists/carbidopa-levodopa \"meds:dopamine-agonists:carbidopa-levodopa\") before their symptoms resolve)\n    \n\n#### How do we determine whether parkinsonism is due to the use of antipsychotics or Parkinson disease?[](#how-do-we-determine-whether-parkinsonism-is-due-to-the-use-of-an)\n\nIt could be both! Especially in the case in geriatric populations. If older patients have been receiving antipsychotics and develop parkinsonism, these patients may have been developing idiopathic Parkinson disease and the psychiatric symptoms may have been related. It is not always easy to tell the difference between the disease and its adverse effects. The first thing to do, if possible, is to stop the antipsychotic agent and wait 1 to 3 months to see if the symptoms resolve. In most cases, patients with parkinsonism will have a tremor of one or both hands. If it is unilateral, a resting tremor suggests idiopathic Parkinson disease, but if it is symmetric, it is difficult to determine whether it is idiopathic or medication-induced.\n\n#### Medications and the Physical Exam[](#medications-and-the-physical-exam)\n\nWhen assessing for Parkinsonian features, it is important to know if an individual has been on antipsychotics, and if there is any recent dopaminergic medication use.\n\n### Gait Assessment and Special Tests[](#gait-assessment-and-special-tests)\n\n### Writing and Drawing[](#writing-and-drawing)\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic-1)\n\nThe mnemonic `**BALSA**` can be used to remember the common treatments used in Parkinson's\n\n#### Parkinson's Treatment Strategy and Mechanism[](#parkinsons-treatment-strategy-and-mechanism)\n\n| Strategy | Medication | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Dopamine agonists | Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, pramipexole, ropinirole) | \\-  |\n| Increase dopamine availability | Amantadine | Increases dopamine release and decreases dopamine reuptake |\n| Increased L-dopa availability | Levodopa, entacapone, tolcapone | These agents prevent peripheral (pre-BBB) L-Dopa degradation and increases central L-Dopa available for conversion to dopamine. Entacapone and tolcapone prevent peripheral L-Dopa degradation by inhibiting COMT. Used in conjunction with levodopa. |\n| Prevent dopamine breakdown | Selegiline, rasagiline | Block conversions of dopamine into DOPAC by selectively inhibiting MAO-B. |\n| Decrease excess cholinergic activity | Benztropine, trihexyphenidyl | Improves tremor and rigidity but has little effect on bradykinesia. |\n\n#### Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia[](#levodopa-induced-dyskinesia)\n\nDyskinesia is not caused by Parkinson's Disease. Long‐term use of levodopa often results in significantly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15) Different types of movement disorders are seen in LID, including chorea, ballism, dystonia, myoclonus, or combination of any of these movements. These dyskinesias are seen in the neck, facial muscles, jaw, tongue, hip, shoulder, trunk, and limb or may appear as involuntary flexion of toes. These dyskinesias can often be very debilitating, and even more so than the original Parkinson's symptoms.\n\n#### Guidelines[](#guidelines-1)\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Dorsey, E.

Additionally, the speech production deficits must not be due to a physical, structural, neurological, or hearing impairment. Children with the disorder may not have knowledge of phonological speech sounds, or be unable to coordinate movements (i.e. - articulation) for speech.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\nThere is a prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9 percent.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n[Language disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/communication/language-disorder \"child:communication:language-disorder\") (especially in those expressive deficits) may co-occur with speech sound disorder.

For example, individuals with genetic disorders such as [Down syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/down-syndrome-trisomy-21 \"child:genetic-disorders:down-syndrome-trisomy-21\"), [DiGeorge (22q11.2 Deletion) syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/digeorge-syndrome-22q11.2-22q-deletion \"child:genetic-disorders:digeorge-syndrome-22q11.2-22q-deletion\"), and the FoxP2 gene mutation may have speech sound disorder.\n\nMost children with speech sound disorder respond well to speech therapy.

These characteristics reflect the individual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just occasional occurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple information sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of time (e.g. - parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).\n    \n    *   **Lack of remorse or guilt**: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does some thing wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and/or facing punishment).

For example, the individual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of breaking rules.\n        \n    *   **Callous—lack of empathy**: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others.\n        \n    *   **Unconcerned about performance**: Does not show concern about poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor performance.\n        \n    *   **Shallow or deficient affect**: Does not express feelings or show emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g. - actions contradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off’ quickly) or when emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g. - emotions displayed to manipulate or intimidate others).\n        \n\n## Screening and Rating Scales[](#screening-and-rating-scales)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** American Psychiatric Association.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/brain-stimulation/ect","markdown":"##### History[](#history)\n\nDuring the late 1930s it was observed that people suffering from both epilepsy and serious mental illnesses exhibited an interesting phenomenon in the aftermath of a seizure. These individuals would have a reduction in psychiatric symptoms, lasting anywhere from days to weeks.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Based on these observations, seizures were induced in patients who did not otherwise have epilepsy. It was found that the safest way to accomplish this was by delivering an electrical shock to the head.\n\n#### A Dark History[](#a-dark-history)\n\nECT was used extensively and indiscriminately in the first three decades of it discovery, due to the lack of psychiatric medications at the time (the pre-[antipsychotic](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\") and [antidepressant](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/home \"meds:antidepressants:home\") era). This indiscriminate use came with serious complications and valid concerns. The public perception of ECT later became characterized in numerous movies (e.g. - _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_), and was portrayed as an inhumane, horrific, and frightening procedure. This exaggerated portrayal in popular culture unfortunately stigmatized an effective and often life-saving procedure when used in the right patients with serious mental illness.\n\n##### Current Practice[](#current-practice)\n\nToday, ECT is used effectively to treat various psychiatric disorders, including severe mood disorders (i.e. - severe depression with melancholic features, psychotic depression, and severe, acute mania). Techniques and safety protocols for administering ECT have also changed dramatically. ECT is now an anesthetic procedure, and requires the use of general anesthesia and muscle relaxants. The patient is therefore fully anesthetized and asleep during the procedure. Serious or persistent side effects now extremely rare. Although, ECT is often considered a treatment of last resort, in most jurisdictions, it remains under-utilized due to stigma. ECT can be extremely effective and, at times, a life-saving procedure. ECT remains a first-line treatment for many psychiatric disorders.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\nIndications for ECT include:\n\n##### Cardiac[](#cardiac)\n\n##### Brain[](#brain)\n\nIt is important to inform patients about the risks and benefits of ECT.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability","markdown":"**Intellectual Disability (ID)** (also known as **Intellectual Developmental Disorder**, and previously Mental Retardation) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in 3 domains: (1) conceptual, (2) social, and (3) practical domains. Intellectual disability is a heterogeneous condition with many different etiologies. Two other diagnoses exist under the intellectual disability diagnostic category in the DSM-5: [Global Developmental Delay](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability#global-developmental-delay \"child:intellectual-disability\") and [Unspecified Intellectual Disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability#unspecified-intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\").\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\nIntellectual disability has a population prevalence of approximately 1%, and varies by age. Prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approximately 0.6%. Males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with both mild and severe forms of intellectual disability.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n#### The History of 'Mental Retardation'[](#the-history-of-mental-retardation)\n\n_Mental retardation_ was a diagnostic label that included the the categories of _idiot_, _imbecile_, and _moron_, based on early IQ testing data. All of these terms started as medical terms, and did not have the negative and pejorative connotations that they now have in popular culture. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a bill known as Rosa's Law, which required the terms “mental retardation” and “mentally retarded” to be removed from federal use.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) These terms were replaced with “intellectual disability” and “individual with an intellectual disability,” which is reflected by a change in the DSM-5 as well.\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\nIntellectual disability is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following `3` criteria must be met:\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nDeficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, [standardized intelligence testing](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/psychoeducational-assessment \"child:learning:psychoeducational-assessment\").\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nDeficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nOnset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.\n\n#### Severity Specifier[](#severity-specifier)\n\n**Specify whether:**\n\n*   Mild\n    \n*   Moderate\n    \n*   Severe\n    \n*   Profound\n    \n\n**Global Developmental Delay** is a diagnosis for individuals **under the age of `5` years** when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. The diagnosis is given when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassessment after a period of time.\n\n**Unspecified Intellectual Disability** is a diagnosis for individuals **over the age of `5` years** when assessment of the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) by means of locally available procedures is difficult or impossible because of sensory or physical impairments (like blindness, prelingual deafness, locomotor disability, presence of severe problem behaviors, or co-occurring mental disorder). This category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.\n\n#### How is Intellectual Disability Actually Measured?[](#how-is-intellectual-disability-actually-measured)\n\nIntellectual functioning is usually measured with an individually administered and psychometrically valid, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate tests of intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores that are **`2` standard deviations (or more)** below the population mean. This includes a margin of error (generally ± 5 points).\n\nFor example, the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) has a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. This means a score of 65-75 (70 ± 5) would indicate intellectual disability. However, it is important to note that clinical training and judgment is required to accurately interpret this result, and to rule out other causes of this score.\n\nIntellectual disability can be due to genetic syndromes at birth including: [Down syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/genetic-disorders/down-syndrome-trisomy-21 \"child:genetic-disorders:down-syndrome-trisomy-21\"), Rett syndrome, and San Phillippo syndrome (among many others). Other times, it can be acquired due to an illness such as meningitis, encephalitis, or a [traumatic brain injury](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/tbi \"cl:tbi\") during the developmental period. Prenatal causes include: inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations, maternal disease or placental disease. Postnatal causes include hypoxic ischemic injury, infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders (e.g. - infantile spasms), severe and chronic social deprivation, toxic metabolic syndromes, and heavy metal intoxications (e.g. - lead, mercury).\n\nA diagnosis of intellectual disability should not be presumed simply because of a pre-existing genetic or medical condition. A differential diagnosis includes:\n\nA comprehensive work up for intellectual disability includes assessing intellectual capacity and adaptive functioning, identifying genetic, non-genetic, and associated medical conditions (such as cerebral palsy and seizure disorders). A prenatal/perinatal history, family pedigree, physical examination, genetic evaluation (karyotype, chromosomal microarray, and/or genetic syndrome tests), metabolic screening, and neuroimaging assessment can also be important investigations.\n\nMedications, particularly [antipsychotics](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\"), may be used to manage challenging behaviour such as aggression in individuals with intellectual disability. When the behaviour does not arise from an underlying mental illness, this is off-label use and evidence of efficacy is very poor.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) Furthermore, these patients face higher risks of drug-related side effects.\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Healthcare Providers[](#for-healthcare-providers)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** American Psychiatric Association.

A learning disability is not exactly the same as an individual with specific learning disorder. However, most individuals with a diagnosis of specific learning disorder will also meet criteria for a learning disability.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nDifficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least `6` months, despite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties:\n\n1.  Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g. - reads single words aloud incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding out words).\n    \n2.  Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g. - may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).\n    \n3.  Difficulties with spelling (e.g. - may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).\n    \n4.  Difficulties with written expression (e.g. - makes multiple grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expression of ideas lacks clarity).\n    \n5.  Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g. - has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).\n    \n6.  Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g. - has severe difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).\n    \n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individually administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age `17` years and older, a documented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nThe learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual’s limited capacities (e.g. - as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe learning difficulties are not better accounted for by [intellectual disabilities](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\"), uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction.\n\nThese four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the individual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and [psychoeducational assessment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/psychoeducational-assessment \"child:learning:psychoeducational-assessment\").\n\nDyslexia is a specific learning disorder that refers to difficulty with reading. Individuals with dyslexia have difficulty connecting letters they see on a page with the sounds they make. As a result, reading becomes a slow, effortful and not a fluent process for them.\n\nProblems in reading begin even before learning to read. Kindergarten-age children may not be able to recognize and write letters as well as their peers. People with dyslexia may have difficulty with accuracy and spelling as well. Common myths include thinking that children with dyslexia write letters backwards or those who write letters backwards all have dyslexia. Individuals with dyslexia may try to avoid activities that require reading whenever they can (e.g. - reading for pleasure, reading instructions). They may often gravitate to other mediums of expression such as pictures, video, or audio.\n\nDysgraphia is a specific learning disorder used to describe difficulties with putting one’s thoughts on to paper. Problems with writing can include difficulties with spelling, grammar, punctuation, and handwriting.\n\nDyscalculia is a specific learning disorder used to describe difficulties learning number related concepts or using the symbols and functions to perform math calculations. Problems with math can include difficulties with number sense, memorizing math facts, math calculations, math reasoning and math problem solving.\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)"}
{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/psychoeducational-assessment","markdown":"## Psychoeducational and Intelligence Assessments[](#psychoeducational-and-intelligence-assessments)\n\nA **Psychoeducational Assessment** identifies factors that may have an impact on any aspect of an individual's learning. This assessment is used to determine the individual's _learning profile_. Factors that can affect an individual's profile includes their ability to process, retain, or output information. These factors can either have a positive impact (in the case of giftedness) or a negative impact (in the case of a [learning disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/home \"child:learning:home\") or [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\")).\n\n#### When do you order a psychoeducational assessment?[](#when-do-you-order-a-psychoeducational-assessment)\n\nA psychoeducational assessment should be done when: an individual has considerable academic difficulties, unreasonable efforts are needed to maintain school grades, there are questions about diagnoses, a patient's behavioural and social functioning is significantly impaired, or a choice of intervention best suited for a patient's learning profile needs to be identified.\n\nA psychoeducational assessment consists of multiple components as described here:\n\nCognitive Abilities, popularly referred to as the intelligence quotient (IQ), is one measurement in the psychoeducational assessment. There are many different standardized tests that measure IQ, with one of the most common being the [Wechsler Intelligence Scales](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/psychoeducational-assessment#wechsler-intelligence-scale-for-children-wisc \"child:learning:psychoeducational-assessment\") (described below).\n\nTests such as the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) are a common measure of academic achievement. Academic achievement is the individual's academic abilities in the following areas:\n\n1.  **Reading**\n    \n2.  **Writing**\n    \n3.  **Mathematics**\n    \n4.  **Oral Language**\n    \n\n#### IQ ≠ Academic Achievement[](#iq-≠-academic-achievement)\n\nAlthough _generally_ predictive, an individual's IQ does not always predict academic achievement.\n\nOther cognitive factors that can impact learning include:\n\nAdaptive functioning is how well an individual manages the common demands of day-to-day life, and how independent they are compared to others with a similar age and background. Areas assessed include communication, community function, functional academics, home living, health and safety, leisure activities, self-care, self-direction, social interactions, and work place interactions. These factors are usually assessed by questionnaires completed by teachers, family, or caregivers.\n\nOther non-cognitive factors that can impact learning include:\n\nStandardized and normed educational assessment measures are the mainstay of psychoeducational assessments and testing. The individual's response to teaching, collateral information from self-report, parents, and teachers are also considered. The different Wechsler scales and tests are briefly described here.\n\nThe **Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)** measures intelligence in children between ages 6 to 16, in two areas (verbal intelligence and performance intelligence), across 4 domains (perceptual, verbal, working memory, processing speed. Verbal intelligence measures include vocabulary and comprehension. Performance intelligence includes picture completion and reasoning. The exam is administered in 60-80 minutes, with 100 being the average score. The adult version of this test is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).\n\n#### WISC does not assess for reading![](#wisc-does-not-assess-for-reading)\n\nThe WISC does not assess reading skills, which is needed to assess for academic performance. Thus, the WIAT needs to be used if assessing for a [specific learning disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/home \"child:learning:home\").\n\nThe **Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)** is an intelligence quotient (IQ) test that measures intelligence and cognitive ability in adolescents and adults. It is the most widely used IQ test. It can be thought of the adult version of the WISC (which is for children). The WAIS consists of 4 components that can be grouped into 1 of 2 categories (_reasoning abilities_ and _supportive processes of the brain_):\n\n1.  **Verbal Reasoning** - How does an individual think about and solve problems using language? (tests reasoning abilities)\n    \n2.  **Non-Verbal Reasoning** - A universal test of intelligence (tests reasoning abilities)\n    \n3.  **Working-Memory** - How good is the individual at multitasking? (tests supportive processes of the brain)\n    \n4.  **Processing Speed** - How fast is information processed by this individual? (tests supportive processes of the brain)\n    \n\nBy understanding an individual’s IQ alone, one can determine if they meet the criteria of giftedness (the top 2 percentile of the population, by age and sex). If an individual's IQ and adaptive functioning (see below) is below the 2nd percentile (i.e. - IQ < 70), they are considered to have an [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\").\n\nThe **Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT)** is an achievement test that measures how an individual (age 4 to 19 years) performs in academic school work. It assesses basic reading, mathematics reasoning, numerical operations, spelling, listening comprehension, reading comprehension, oral expression, and written expression. Similar to the WISC, an average score is 100.\n\n#### Comparing the Wechsler Tests[](#comparing-the-wechsler-tests)\n\n| Guideline | Age range | Measures | When to order | Average score | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) | Adolescents to Adults | Intelligence | For assessing [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\") or giftedness | 100 | \\-  |\n| Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) | 6 to 16 years | Intelligence | For assessing [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\") or giftedness | 100 | WISC assesses intelligence and does not assess school performance! |\n| Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) | 4 to 19 years | Academic school performance | Assessing for [learning disorders](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/home \"child:learning:home\") | 100 | WIAT assesses academic performance and does not predict intelligence |\n\n#### You Cannot Have Both a Learning Disorder/Disability and Intellectual Disability[](#you-cannot-have-both-a-learning-disorder-disability-and-intellec)\n\nA [learning disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/learning/home \"child:learning:home\") (i.e. - learning disorder) and [intellectual disability](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/intellectual-disability \"child:intellectual-disability\") are two mutually exclusive diagnoses. You can have one or the other, but never both!\n\nA learning disability is when an individual's _academic achievement does not meet their expected level of function for their given IQ score_. By identifying the IQ-academic achievement gap with a psychoeducational assessment, the gap/discrepancy can be narrowed and the individual will be able to function better academically as a result. Methods to address this gap include proper access to special education resources, educational accommodations (e.g. - extended examination time) or more appropriate academic placements (e.g. - gifted classes).\n\n### Articles[](#articles)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/motor/tic-disorders","markdown":"**Tics** are sudden, rapid, recurrent, _non-rhythmic_ motor movements or vocalizations. Individuals with tics experience a feeling of a mounting inner tension or urge (known as a premonitory urge), which is transiently relieved by tic expression. Tics will wax and wane with time, and can be worsened with stress, fatigue, or excitement. Although tics can include almost any muscle group or vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are more common. Tics are generally experienced as “involuntary” but are usually temporarily suppressible. **Tourette’s Disorder** is the most “famous” of the tic disorders.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\n## Classification and Terminology[](#classification-and-terminology)\n\nTic disorders can be classified in to 4 disorders:\n\n1.  Tourette’s disorder\n    \n2.  Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder\n    \n3.  Provisional tic disorder\n    \n4.  Other specified and unspecified tic disorders\n    \n\n#### Remember the Diagnostic Hierarchy[](#remember-the-diagnostic-hierarchy)\n\nTic disorders are hierarchical in order - once a tic disorder at one level of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis _cannot_ be made (Criterion E). The escalating hierarchy of diagnosis is (1) other specified and unspecified tic disorders (lowest) → (2) provisional tic disorder → (3) persistent motor or vocal tic disorder → (4) Tourette’s disorder (highest).\n\n##### Simple and Complex Tics[](#simple-and-complex-tics)\n\nTics can be either simple or complex:\n\n#### Does Someone With Tics Always Swear?[](#does-someone-with-tics-always-swear)\n\n_Coprolalia_, the involuntary swearing or utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks, is a common popular culture assumption of what tics look like. However, coprolalia has a point prevalence of only 15-20% of population (i.e. - 15-20% will have coprolalia at some point, and not consistently).\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a)\n\nBoth `multiple` motor and `1` or more vocal tics have been present at sometime during the illness, although not necessarily concurrently.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b)\n\nThe tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than `1` year since first tic onset.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c)\n\nOnset is before age `18` years.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d)\n\nThe disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - [cocaine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/stimulants/home \"addictions:stimulants:home\")) or another medical condition (e.g. - [Huntington’s disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/huntingtons-disease \"cl:huntingtons-disease\"), post-viral [encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/home \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:home\")).\n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a1)\n\n`Single` or `multiple` motor or vocal tics have been present during the illness, but **not** both motor and vocal.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b1)\n\nThe tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than `1` year since first tic onset.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c1)\n\nOnset is before age `18` years.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d1)\n\nThe disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - [cocaine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/stimulants/home \"addictions:stimulants:home\")) or another medical condition (e.g. - [Huntington’s disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/huntingtons-disease \"cl:huntingtons-disease\"), post-viral [encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/home \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:home\")).\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e)\n\nCriteria have **never** been met for Tourette’s disorder.\n\n#### Specifiers[](#specifiers)\n\n**Specify if:**\n\n*   With motor tics only\n    \n*   With vocal tics only\n    \n\n##### Criterion A[](#criterion-a2)\n\n`Single` or `multiple` motor and/or vocal tics.\n\n##### Criterion B[](#criterion-b2)\n\nThe tics have been present for less than `1` year since first tic onset.\n\n##### Criterion C[](#criterion-c2)\n\nOnset is before age `18` years.\n\n##### Criterion D[](#criterion-d2)\n\nThe disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. - [cocaine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/stimulants/home \"addictions:stimulants:home\")) or another medical condition (e.g. - [Huntington’s disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/huntingtons-disease \"cl:huntingtons-disease\"), post-viral [encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/home \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:home\")).\n\n##### Criterion E[](#criterion-e1)\n\nCriteria have **never** been met for Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder.\n\n#### Examples of Complex and Simple Tics[](#examples-of-complex-and-simple-tics)\n\nSimple vocal tics include:\n\n*   Throat clearing\n    \n*   Sniffling\n    \n*   Squeaking\n    \n*   Grunting\n    \n*   Sounds like “eep!”\n    \n\nComplex vocal tics are:\n\n*   Linguistically meaningful sounds\n    \n*   Sentences like “Oh boy now you've done it!”\n    \n*   Swearing\n    \n*   Echolalia\n    \n*   Palilalia\n    \n\n#### Comparison[](#comparison)\n\n|     | Tourette's | Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder | Provisional Tic Disorder |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Type of Tics | Multiple motor AND at least 1 vocal | Motor OR Verbal | Motor AND/OR Verbal |\n| Length | \\> 1 year | \\> 1 year | < 1 year |\n| Age of onset | Before age 18 | Before age 18 | Before age 18 |\n\nEducation and support for the patient's family and school is a first-line treatment.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) Remember as a clinician to educated families that the natural history of tics is that they wax and wane, which can confound medication treatment. It’s possible the tics will get worse, _despite_ treatment. Take your time.\n\n#### Accommodating Tics[](#accommodating-tics)\n\nAccommodations should be made in the individual's environment to make tics for manageable for the patient and the people around them. Examples include:\n\n*   Asking parents and teachers to accept/ignore minor tics\n    \n*   Accommodate for other tics where possible by:\n    \n    *   Using objects (rugs, foam) to dampen sounds from motor tics\n        \n    *   Replacing words (saying “shoot” instead of “shit”)\n        \n*   Work with the child in problem solving\n    \n*   Allow graceful exits\n    \n*   Encourage accountability through restoration and reparations\n    \n\nHabit reversal therapy (HRT) is a behavioural treatment used to reduce repetitive behaviours. It is a second line treatment for Tourette's, after providing education about the disorder.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\nPharmacotherapy is primarily with alpha-2 agonists or antipsychotics. Note that rebound hypertension can occur if clonidine is stopped abruptly and not tapered.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8)\n\n#### Pharmacological Treatment for Tic Disorders[](#pharmacological-treatment-for-tic-disorders)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st line | [Clonidine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist/clonidine \"meds:alpha-2-adrenergic-agonist:clonidine\") 0.05 mg PO daily as a starting dose, and titrate to 0.15 to 0.3mg PO once daily |\n| 2nd line |     |\n| 3rd line |     |\n| Adjunctive therapy |     |\n| Not recommended |     |\n\n#### Do Stimulants Exacerbate Tics?[](#do-stimulants-exacerbate-tics)\n\nHistorically, it has been recommended that stimulants not be used to treat ADHD associated with tic disorders. Some current guidelines still recommend that stimulants are contraindicated in children with Tourette's or even a family history of Tourette's. However, more recent studies have found that on average, stimulants _do not_ exacerbate tics in children with tic disorders, and guidelines have not been updated to reflect this.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9) Therefore, having tics or Tourettes is not a contraindication to use of stimulants in ADHD but careful monitoring is required. required.\n\n#### Guidelines[](#guidelines-1)\n\n| Guideline | Location | Year | PDF | Website |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Canadian Guidelines for the Evidence Based Treatment of Tourette Syndrome | Canada | 2012 | [Link](http://www.bcmhsus.ca/Documents/canadian-guidelines-for-the-evidence-based-treatment-of-tourette-syndrome.pdf \"http://www.bcmhsus.ca/Documents/canadian-guidelines-for-the-evidence-based-treatment-of-tourette-syndrome.pdf\") | \\-  |\n| American Academy of Neurology (AAN) | USA | 2019 | \\-  | [Link](https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GuidelineDetail/958 \"https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GuidelineDetail/958\") |\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Leckman, J.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/home","markdown":"**Benzodiazepines** are a class of psychotropic medications with sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects. Benzodiazepines are among the most misused and misprescribed medications in the world.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) Benzodiazepines carry a risk of increased sedation, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression in those with liver impairments, and there is an increased risk of respiratory depression with opioid or alcohol use.\n\nIn 1955, chemist Leo Sternbach while working at Hoffmann-La Roche serendipitously identified the first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium).[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) Initially thought to be less toxic and having little effect on respiratory depression, benzodiazepines became the most commonly prescribed medications in the mid-to-late 1970s. By the 1980s, concerns about addiction and abuse began to come up, particularly for older adults.\n\nAll benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver. However, some benzodiazepines (i.e. - lorazepam, oxazepam, and tamazepam) do not go through cytochrome P450 metabolism (Phase I metabolism), and are only metabolized via glucuronidation (Phase II metabolism).\n\n### Metabolites and Special Populations[](#metabolites-and-special-populations)\n\nBenzodiazepines (and Z-drugs in general) are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs - this is not the same as agonists!) that act on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptor binding sites that potentiates GABA's inhibitory effect. The combination of GABA at the GABA-A receptor’s agonist site and a benzodiazepine-receptor agonist at the positive allosteric site increases the overall frequency of the chloride channel opening than GABA alone by itself. When a greater frequency of chloride ions to enter through the receptor, this increases polarization and increases GABA-mediated inhibitory action.\n\nBenzodiazepines are highly protein bound, distribute widely in the body, and accumulate in lipid-rich areas such as the central nervous system and fatty tissue. The more lipophilic a benzodiazepine, the higher the rate of absorption and faster the onset of clinical action. For example, [diazepam](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/1-diazepam \"meds:benzos:1-diazepam\") and [midazolam](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/8-midazolam \"meds:benzos:8-midazolam\") have the highest lipid solubility and therefore also the quickest onset of action.\n\n [![GABA Receptor Mechanism of Action (GABA and PAM receptor sites)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/benzos/gaba.png?w=250&tok=8d49a5 \"GABA Receptor Mechanism of Action (GABA and PAM receptor sites)\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/benzos/gaba.png \"meds:benzos:gaba.png\") Fig. 1 : GABA Receptor Mechanism of Action (GABA and PAM receptor sites)[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/benzos/gaba.png)\n\nMost indications for benzodiazepines are based on short-term studies and used in acute medical conditions such as:\n\n#### Naming Tip[](#naming-tip)\n\nAll benzodiazepines end in -_pam_ or -_lam_, The only exception are the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and clorazepate.\n\nNote that most benzodiazepine equivalence estimates are based on expert clinical opinion, hypothesized equivalence tables (see above links).

The recommended amount of sleep varies by age, but declines with age.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Ultimately, the required sleep time is individualized – it is the amount of sleep required for a person to feel rested and restored the next day.

Phasic REM sleep is characterized by skeletal muscle twitches, increased heart rate variability, pupillary dilation, and increased respiratory rate. Tonic REM is characterized by EMG suppression (i.e. - no more muscle twitches), a high arousal threshold (much more difficult to wake up the individual), elevated brain temperature, poikilothermia (loss of thermoregulation), and penile tumescence (spontaneous erection).\n\nAll antidepressants (except for [trazodone](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/sari/trazodone \"meds:antidepressants:sari:trazodone\") and [bupropion](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ndri/bupropion \"meds:antidepressants:ndri:bupropion\")) increase REM latency and suppress REM sleep. Atypical antipsychotic medications also generally suppress REM sleep, while increasing amounts of stage N3.\n\n#### REM Latency[](#rem-latency)\n\n**REM latency** is the time from when someone _falls asleep_ to the time of _first onset of REM sleep_. REM sleep occurs every 90 to 120 minutes throughout the night. Thus, changes in REM sleep latency are considered a markers for sleep-related disorders. Short/decreased REM latency (i.e. - a faster time to REM onset) can be due to:\n\n*   First night of CPAP use\n    \n\nSleep consists of two physiological states: **non-rapid eye movement sleep** (known as NREM) and **rapid eye movement sleep** (also known as REM):\n\n1.  **NREM** sleep can be broken down into three stages: N1, N2, and N3 (or four stages based on: Stages 1, 2, 3/4).\n    \n2.  **REM** sleep is a different state of sleep characterized by high levels of brain activity and physiological activity similar to an awake state. REM sleep usually develops about 90 minutes after sleep begins. REM sleep on a polysomnograph appears the same as the awake stage. Therefore, REM cannot be identified by EEG alone, you need an EMG (and see absence of muscle activity) to confirm the presence of REM\n    \n\n#### Sleep Stages[](#sleep-stages-1)\n\n| Stage of Sleep | % Total Sleep Time | Description | Function | EEG | Eye Movements | Muscle Tone |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Awake (eyes open) | \\-  | • Alert and active mental focus | Wakefulness | • **Beta, 15–60 Hz**  <br>• This is the highest frequency, lowest amplitude EEG | Eyes move and blink | High voluntary tonic activity |\n| Awake (eyes closed) | \\-  | • Restful state but not sleeping | Wakefulness | **Alpha waves, 8-12 Hz** | Eyes move | High voluntary tonic activity |\n| Stage N1 (Stage 1) | 5%  | • Also known as “light sleep.” It is the transition from wakefulness → sleep and vice versa  <br>• Individuals may often be in this stage and think they are “not sleeping.”  <br>• Increased light quality sleep indicates sleep disruption | Prominent alpha waves = becoming more drowsy | • **Theta waves (low amplitude, mixed frequency), 4-8 Hz and some alpha waves, 8-12 Hz**  <br>• In N1, alpha makes <50% of EEG and is mixed with theta waves  <br>• Note that N1 can be very similar to a waking EEG | Slow rolling eye movements (SREMs) are usually the first evidence of drowsiness seen on the EEG | Decreasing levels of high tonic activity |\n| Stage N2 (Stage 2) | 50% | • Most of the night is spent in N2!  <br>• Sleep spindles and K-complexes emerge during this stage and are thought to be the brain's way of evaluating potential threats (i.e. - external stimuli) while sleeping and to dampen arousals if the threats are not real. |     | • **Sleep spindles (Sigma waves), 11-16 Hz**  <br>• **K-complexes (negative sharp wave followed by positive slow waves), 12-14 Hz** | None | Low tonic activity |\n| Stage N3 (Stage 3 and 4) | 10-20% | • The “deepest” stage and hardest to awaken, also called Slow Wave Sleep (SWS)  <br>• Associated with sleep inertia when awoken in this stage  <br>• It is also the most restorative sleep. | This is homeostatic sleep (reduced BP, HR, cardiac output, RR). Growth hormone is released. | • **Delta waves, 0.5-4 Hz**  <br>• This is the lowest frequency, highest amplitude EEG | None | Low tonic activity |\n| Rapid Eye Movement (REM) | 25% | • A “paradoxical state” that resembles awake state, except there is muscle  <br>• Arousal with increased oxygen use, increased variability of autonomic state (BP, HR). Increased brain temperature, cerebral glucose metabolism and cerebral blood flow.  <br>• Release of acetylcholine in the cortex is highest during wakefulness and also during REM sleep.  <br>• Occurs every 90 minutes, and REM length grows longer through the night. | Cognitive sleep, learning, cognitive restructuring. | • **High (fast waves) and mixed frequency, with low voltage**  <br>• Also includes: saw-tooth waves, theta activity, and slow alpha activity  <br>• Looks similar to EEG of awake individual with their eyes closed | Rapid eye movement | Almost total muscle paralysis (during tonic phase of REM). There can be very brief movement during phasic periods. |\n\n [![Stages of Sleep with Polysomnograph Recordings](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/1-introduction/sleep-graph.png?w=700&tok=287ff0 \"Stages of Sleep with Polysomnograph Recordings\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/1-introduction/sleep-graph.png \"sleep:1-introduction:sleep-graph.png\") Fig. 1 : Stages of Sleep with Polysomnograph Recordings[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/1-introduction/sleep-graph.png)\n\n [![Adult Brain Waves (EEG)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/eeg-beta-alpha-theta-delta-waves.png?w=700&tok=89f93c \"Adult Brain Waves (EEG)\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/eeg-beta-alpha-theta-delta-waves.png \"neurology:eeg-beta-alpha-theta-delta-waves.png\") Fig. 1 : Adult Brain Waves (EEG)[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/eeg-beta-alpha-theta-delta-waves.png)\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**BAT-D**` (Think of a bat!) can be used to remember the order of brain waves from wakefulness → deep sleep.

By adulthood, about 20% of sleep is REM sleep. REM sleep continues to decrease into old age. Older adults generally have more insomnia, find it harder to stay up late (due to relative advance of sleep phase), and have more shallow sleep. Sleep disruptions are common, including more brief awakenings. Sleep may also be less restorative, and there may be daytime sleepiness.\n\n [![Sleep Pattern Changes with Age](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png?w=700&tok=34e235 \"Sleep Pattern Changes with Age\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png \"sleep:sleep_changes_with_age.png\") Fig. 1 : Sleep Pattern Changes with Age[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/sleep/sleep_changes_with_age.png)\n\nInsomnia is more prevalent in late life and sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Sleep disturbance in older adults is associated with cognitive impairment, poor concentration, and decreased day-to-day functional performance. One of the challenges in identifying sleep disorders in older adults is that sleep architecture naturally changes significantly in healthy older adults ([figure 5](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/polysomnography#img_image2)). In general with older adults:\n\n [![Hypnogram Comparing Sleep Across the Lifespan](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/sleep_stages_young_adult_vs._elderly.png \"Hypnogram Comparing Sleep Across the Lifespan\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/sleep_stages_young_adult_vs._elderly.png \"neurology:sleep_stages_young_adult_vs._elderly.png\") Fig. 5 : Hypnogram Comparing Sleep Across the Lifespan[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/sleep_stages_young_adult_vs._elderly.png)\n\nIn narcolepsy, changes in sleep include:\n\nCharacteristic changes are seen in REM sleep in depression including:[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Hirshkowitz, M., Whiton, K., Albert, S.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-seizures","markdown":"**Seizures** are sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain. The presentation can vary from uncontrolled jerking movement (tonic-clonic seizures) to something as subtle as a momentary loss of awareness (absence seizure).\n\nAn epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an _enduring_ predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is not a single disease, but rather a collection of disorders that have in common the epileptic seizure event.\n\n#### What's the difference between seizures and epilepsy?[](#whats-the-difference-between-seizures-and-epilepsy)\n\nAlthough the two terms are often used simultaneously, they do not mean the same thing:\n\n*   Seizure = a single event\n    \n*   Epilepsy = `2` or more unprovoked seizures\n    \n    *   Seizures caused by metabolic (e.g. - hypoglycemia, hyponatremia), toxic (e.g. - uremia), or substance use (alcohol withdrawal seizures) does not count towards a diagnosis of epilepsy\n        \n\n### Triggers and Risk Factors[](#triggers-and-risk-factors)\n\nTriggers for seizures include:\n\nStatus epilepticus is defined as when there is more than 5 minutes of a continuous seizure OR there are 2 or more discrete seizures in which there is incomplete recovery of consciousness. [Lorazepam](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/benzos/4-lorazepam \"meds:benzos:4-lorazepam\") is the first line in-hospital treatment for status epilepticus.\n\nA pratical definition of epilepsy is if the patient meets `1` of the following:[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n1.  At least `2` unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart\n    \n2.  `1` unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after `2` unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next `10` years\n    \n3.  Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome\n    \n\nSeizures can either be generalized or focal (partial). Any focal seizure can _evolve_ into a bilateral convulsive seizure. A focal seizure usually evolves into a bilateral seizure when the head begins to turn to the direction contralateral to the hemisphere of seizure origin.\n\nFocal seizures are:\n\nFocal seizures can be further classified into:\n\n1.  **Impairment of consciousness** (also known as complex partial seizures or focal dyscognitive)\n    \n2.  **No impairment of consciousness** (also known as simple partial seizures)\n    \n\nGeneralized seizures involve both cerebral hemispheres. There are 6 types of generalized epileptic seizures:\n\n1.  **Tonic** = sustained contraction\n    \n2.  **Atonic** = complete loss of sustained contraction (drop seizures)\n    \n3.  **Clonic** = contracting/relaxing\n    \n4.  **Myoclonic** = brief contraction\n    \n5.  **Absence** = nothing happening, blank stare (note: it is rare for an absence seizure to last longer than `15` seconds[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2))\n    \n6.  **Tonic-Clonic** = sustained contraction plus contracting/relaxing\n    \n\nTaking a history for seizures is important, as this will help you determine the etiology and type of seizure.\n\n**Mesial temporal sclerosis** (or hippocampal sclerosis) is scarring in the inner portions of the temporal lobe, especially in the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus. It is the most common pathological finding in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\nFocal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders of cortical formation, which are one of the most common causes of epilepsy and can be associated with hippocampal sclerosis and cortical glioneuronal neoplasms.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\n##### Safety[](#safety)\n\nEnsure the ABCs are monitored closely and that supplemental oxygen is available. Make sure the patient is not at risk of falling, and remove restrictive clothing. Do not place anything in the patient’s mouth unless it is a bite block or an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) to protect the tongue.\n\nFirst-line treatment is with benzodiazepines IV until seizures are controlled:\n\nIf there is difficulty with IV access, lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam can all be given IM. PR delivery can also be considered. PO benzodiazepines should not be used unless they are alert and have a normal mental status.\n\n#### Status Epilepticus Treatment[](#status-epilepticus-treatment)\n\n| Medications | Management |\n| --- | --- |\n| • Lorazepam 2-4mg IV push  <br>• If ongoing seizure activity after 5 minutes, repeat x1, give phenytoin 20mg/kg, give simultaneously | • ABCs  <br>• Pin prick blood glucose  <br>• Thiamine 100mg IM/IV prior to administrations of dextrose  <br>• Give 1 amp D50W if glucose low or unknown  <br>• Cardiac monitor  <br>• Obtain bloodwork |\n| • If ongoing seizure activity, consult ICU for intubation and infusion of either: midazolam OR propofol | • Give bolus medications until seizure stops  <br>• For breakthrough seizures, re-bolus and increase rate of infusions  <br>• Begin continuous EEG monitoring if IV infusion used or patient does not wake up rapidly with resolution of convulsions |\n| • For ongoing seizure activity, add additional agents via IV or NG tube, e.g. - valproate, levetiracetam, phenobarbital  <br>• Phenytoin (Dilantin) is given as a secondary drug to prevent recurrent seizures, because of lorazepam's short half life | • Obtain neuroimaging when convulsions stop  <br>• Consider lumbar puncture/antibiotics if there is a clinical suspicion of infection |\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Fisher, R.

Although most commonly used for depression and anxiety, CBT has also been specialized to treat other conditions, such as [CBT for insomnia (CBT-I)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychotherapy/cbt-insomnia \"psychotherapy:cbt-insomnia\") for [insomnia disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/sleep/2-insomnia-disorder \"sleep:2-insomnia-disorder\"), and trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) for [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/trauma-and-stressors/ptsd \"trauma-and-stressors:ptsd\").\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n[![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/amazon_aff/cbt.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2XNyXfr)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XNyXfr)\n\nPsychDB is an Amazon Associate and earns from qualifying purchases. Thank you for supporting our site!\n\nCBT techniques include identifying distortions such as overgeneralization of negative events, catastrophizing, minimizing positive events, and maximizing negative events. Patients work with therapists to identify and change cognitive distortions and avoidance behaviours that cause their symptoms. This frequently involves keeping diaries or “thought records” outside of sessions and practicing behavioural strategies learned in sessions.\n\n1.  CBT is based on an ever-evolving formulation of patients’ problems and an individual conceptualization of each patient in cognitive terms.\n    \n2.  CBT requires a good therapeutic alliance (true for all psychotherapies).\n    \n3.  CBT focuses on collaboration and active participation. Both the therapist and patient should view therapy as teamwork. Together they decide what to work on for each session, how often to meet, and what to do between sessions for therapy homework. At first, the therapist may be more active in suggesting a direction for therapy sessions and in summarizing what's discussed during a session.\n    \n4.  CBT is goal oriented and problem focused. You should ask in your first session for your patient to describe their problems and set specific goals so there is a shared understanding of what they are working towards.\n    \n5.  Self-perception is amenable to change through CBT\n    \n\n [![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/cbt_triangle.png?w=350&tok=3003ad)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/cbt_triangle.png \"psychotherapy:cbt_triangle.png\") Fig. 1: Principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/cbt_triangle.png)\n\nThe key components of CBT include:\n\n1.  **Psychoeducation** about anxiety and feared situations\n    \n2.  **Cognitive restructuring** to address maladaptive thinking and learning coping skills and focused thinking\n    \n3.  **Somatic management techniques** (relaxation training)\n    \n4.  **Gradual, systematic exposure** to feared situations\n    \n5.  **Behavioural activation**\n    \n6.  **Relapse prevention**\n    \n\nCBT uses lots of different terminologies, and it can be helpful to spell out exactly what they mean, so both you and your patients can be speaking the same language.\n\n#### Definitions in CBT[](#definitions-in-cbt)\n\n|     | Description | What to Tell Your Patient |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Feelings | • Feelings are one word (e.g. - “happy, sad, excited”) | “A person can't change their feelings, but they _can_ change their thoughts and behaviours.” |\n| Thoughts | • Thoughts are sentences that run through one's mind. One can have many different thoughts about a situation. | • “Sometimes thoughts are right, but sometimes they can be wrong too”  <br>• Thus, be skeptical of your thoughts! |\n| Actions/Behaviours | • Actions and behaviours are the things one does, and one's behaviours. Thoughts influence actions and behaviours. | \\-  |\n\n**Core beliefs** are fundamental _assumptions_ (not truths) that individuals have made about about themselves, others, and the world. These beliefs develop over the course of their lives. Core beliefs influence how a person sees the world around them and themselves. Core beliefs are usually so connected to a person's identity that they stop noticing them or questioning these beliefs. For example, someone in a depressive episode might think “I am a failure” and because these beliefs are not questioned and assumed to be “100% true,” the individual lives and acts as though they beliefs are real and true.\n\nBeck's cognitive triad, also known as the negative triad, is a cognitive-therapeutic model of the three key elements of a person's belief system when going through depression. The triad involves automatic, spontaneous and seemingly uncontrollable negative thoughts about:\n\n1.  **The self** – “I'm worthless and ugly” or “I wish I was different”\n    \n2.  **The world** – “No one values me” or “people ignore me all the time”\n    \n3.  **The future** – “I'm hopeless because things will never change” or “things can only get worse!”\n    \n\n### Automatic Thoughts and Cognitive Distortions[](#automatic-thoughts-and-cognitive-distortions)\n\nThoughts can often come automatically, and CBT challenges us to think more closely about these thoughts. Some automatic thoughts are true, but many are either untrue or have just a grain of truth. CBT requires patients to use a structured method to evaluate their thinking. Otherwise, their responses to automatic thoughts can be superficial and unconvincing and will fail to improve their mood or functioning. Typical automatic thoughts (also called cognitive distortions) include:\n\n#### Common Automatic Thoughts or Cognitive Distortions[](#common-automatic-thoughts-or-cognitive-distortions)\n\n| Cognitive Distortion | Definition | Automatic Thought |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **All-or-nothing thinking** | Viewing a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum. | “If I’m not a total success, I’m a failure.” |\n| **Catastrophizing** | Predicting the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes. | “I’ll be so upset, I won’t be able to function at all.” |\n| **Emotional reasoning** | Thinking something must be true because you “feel” (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary. | “I know I do a lot of things okay at work, but I still feel like I’m a failure.” |\n| **Disqualifying or discounting the positive** | Unreasonably telling yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count | “I did that project well, but that doesn’t mean I’m competent; I just got lucky.” |\n| **Labeling** | You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion. | “I’m a loser. He’s no good.” |\n| **Magnification/minimization** | When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive. | “Getting a mediocre evaluation proves how inadequate I am. Getting high marks doesn’t mean I’m smart.” |\n| **Mental filter** (Selective abstraction) | When you have a tendency to focus on only one detail (often taken out of context) and ignore all other aspects and more important parts of a situation (e.g. - “seeing the glass as half empty”). | “Because I got one low rating on my evaluation \\[which also contained several high ratings\\] it means I’m doing a lousy job.” |\n| **Mind reading** | You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities. | “He thinks that I don’t know the first thing about this project.” |\n| **Overgeneralization** | You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation. | “\\[Because I felt uncomfortable at the meeting\\] I don’t have what it takes to make friends.” |\n| **Personalization** | You believe others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior. | “The repairman was curt to me because I did something wrong.” |\n| **“Should” and “must” statements** | You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave, and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met. | “It’s terrible that I made a mistake. I should always do my best.” |\n| **Tunnel vision** | You only see the negative aspects of a situation. | “My son’s teacher can’t do anything right. He’s critical and insensitive and lousy at teaching.” |\n| **Magical thinking** | Believing that the course of events in the world depends on your actions and thoughts. | “I need to wash my hands 10 times each time, or else my parents will die.” |\n\n#### Emotional Reasoning Example[](#emotional-reasoning-example)\n\n**Try this out!**\n\n1.  Write this down on sheet of paper: “_I will win the lottery on Friday, Jan 22_”\n    \n2.  Then write this down on sheet of paper: “_My mother will win the lottery on Friday_”\n    \n3.  Finally, write this down on sheet of paper: “_My mother will die on Friday Jan 20th_”\n    \n\n  \nNotice how the first two sentences don't provoke many emotions, but the third sentence is “emotional reasoning,” you might be “reading” into this feeling, thinking: “Might I be jinxing the universe by writing this down?!” This is a tough thing to overcome for individuals who struggled with the cognitive distortion of emotional reasoning every day.\n\nIt is important for the patient to have specific goals they want to achieve by the time they are finished the course of therapy. It is also important to have goals between sessions, that are more attainable and realistic. The SMART goals framework is one way of achieving that. A goal should feel 80% do-able and 20% challenging so as to strike the right balance.\n\nExample of a SMART goal could be: “Add more structure to your day” (i.e. - make your bed, eat regular meals, have a regular sleep schedule, and make a regular schedule). Another SMART goal could be: “Have more social interaction by calling one friend each week.”\n\n#### Homework to Assign after Session 1[](#homework-to-assign-after-session-1)\n\n1.  Define a goals list\n    \n2.  Begin a thought record. Remind yourself to be skeptical of these thoughts and that they may not always be true\n    \n3.  Be kind to yourself\n    \n4.  Think about things you want to bring up at the next session\n    \n5.  Organize an activity to do (this is “behavioural activation”)\n    \n\nJust like how CBT is a structured-form of therapy, your sessions with your patient should also be structured and modeled on that. A typical CBT session should be structured as follows:[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\n#### CBT agenda based on a 60 minute session[](#cbt-agenda-based-on-a-60-minute-session)\n\n| Time | Focus | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Before appointment | Assess symptoms | Patient fills out a scale assessing symptoms (GAD-7, PHQ-9, Beck) |\n| 5-10 minutes | Check-in | What happened last week? Do a “mood check”: how is this week's mood compared to last week's? |\n| 5 minutes | Set the Agenda | Decide: what are the important things that happened that need to be problem-solved today? Prioritize the agenda if there are many problems that happened. |\n| 5 minutes | Bridge | Connect back to the last session: what was important during the last therapy session? |\n| 5 minutes | Homework | Review homework done over the past week. |\n| 30 minutes | Problem Solving | Focus on the core themes of CBT and problem-solve. |\n| 5 minutes | Wrap up | Ask patient for feedback: How did the session go? Is there anything that bothered them or that they didn’t understand? Is there anything they'd like to see changed in future sessions? Assign homework for the next session |\n\nHomework is an integral part of CBT, and what makes CBT work. There are various types of homework assignments including:\n\n#### When Homework Isn't Done[](#when-homework-isnt-done)\n\nYou should ask yourself what is going through your mind when homework isn't being done. Remind yourself that you are not doing your patients any favours if you allow them to skip homework or don't encourage better compliance. The literature shows that patients who do homework assignments regularly have a better prognosis that paints who do not.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8)\n\nThought records are done outside of the CBT session, where patients record their automatic thoughts and feelings over the week:\n\n#### Vague Thought Records[](#vague-thought-records)\n\nIt can sometimes be hard to describe what exact situation occurred when your patient describes their automatic thought to you weeks after the event. By that time, the patient often has had several days to think about their actions-thoughts-behaviours, and it can be easily to over-rationalize those thoughts. To get a better sense of the exact automatic thought and behaviours, it can be helpful to ask your patient: “replay everything back to me like a movie, down to the specific words exchanged and the conversation if you can.” This helps ground the patient on the exact situation at that time, and helps you better understand their thought process.\n\n##### Balancing Thoughts[](#balancing-thoughts)\n\nThe goal of CBT is to help your patients correct the automatic thought (sometimes called “hot thought”), by reaching balanced thoughts (e.g. - “Even though \\[I’m behind on my rent\\], I can see that \\[I have a solution now/and a capable person\\], because \\[I have support from my family\\].”) Beware though, of superficial and “fake” balance thoughts. For example, if a patient is constantly worried about having anxiety because their thought is: “I’m a terrible mom.” and her balanced thought is “but I’m a good wife.” Notice that this balanced thought doesn't actually relate to the thought. If the balancing thought does not correspond with the automatic thought, that’s a pitfall the therapist must identify!\n\n##### Questioning Automatic Thoughts[](#questioning-automatic-thoughts)\n\nWhen addressing automatic thoughts or cognitive distortions, the following questions can be helpful:\n\n1.  What is the evidence that supports this idea? What is the evidence against this idea?\n    \n2.  Is there an alternative explanation or viewpoint?\n    \n3.  What is the worst that could happen (if I’m not already thinking the worst)? If it happened, how could I cope? (What is the best that could happen? What is the most realistic outcome?)\n    \n4.  What is the effect of my believing the automatic thought? What could be the effect of changing my thinking?\n    \n5.  What would I tell \\[a specific friend or family member\\] if he or she were in the same situation?\n    \n6.  What should I do?\n    \n\n## Tips and Techniques[](#tips-and-techniques)\n\nWhen evaluating situations that your patient brings up, here are some helpful techniques:\n\n##### Piecharts[](#piecharts)\n\n##### Percentage Scales[](#percentage-scales)\n\n##### Socratic Questioning[](#socratic-questioning)\n\nSocratic questioning, or the socratic method, is a key technique in CBT. You help your patient understand themselves by asking questions about their thoughts, examples include:\n\n##### Therapeutic Alliance[](#therapeutic-alliance)\n\n##### When emotions are too much[](#when-emotions-are-too-much)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Cuijpers, P., Hollon, S.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/personality/borderline","markdown":"**Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)** is a [personality disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/personality \"personality\") characterized by emotional dysregulation, a pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships and high impulsivity/recklessness. Patients can oscillate quickly between devaluing and idealizing relationships (commonly known as “splitting”). Other features include difficulty controlling anger, recurrent suicidal or self-harm behaviours, identity disturbance, and chronic feelings of emptiness.\n\n##### Epidemiology[](#epidemiology)\n\n##### Prognosis[](#prognosis)\n\n##### Comorbidity[](#comorbidity)\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nBPD is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs (due to repetitive self harm and admissions to hospital). There is a significant suicide rate of about 10%.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) This is a source of significant distress for the patient, clinicians, and their community. Patients often have a chronic suicide risk that does not benefit from hospitalization. As a result, treating chronically suicidal patients requires balancing risks and require careful clinical judgment.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\nThe term “borderline” originated with the concept that this disorder was on the border between neurosis and psychosis, essentially “bordering” on schizophrenia. The name continues as a historical term, but it is most certainly _not_ a psychotic disorder. BPD is a diagnostic label that is used to group common features seen in this clinical population. There is ongoing debate about [changing the name](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmh.73/full \"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmh.73/full\") itself to something more accurate and less stigmatizing, such as emotion regulation disorder. There are also proposals to [change the future diagnostic criteria beyond the DSM-5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105005/ \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105005/\").\n\n### Stigma and Misdiagnosis[](#stigma-and-misdiagnosis)\n\n##### Criterion[](#criterion)\n\nA pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by at least `5` of the following:\n\n1.  Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. (**Note**: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)\n    \n2.  A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.\n    \n3.  Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.\n    \n4.  Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g. - spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). (**Note**: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)\n    \n5.  Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.\n    \n6.  Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g. - intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).\n    \n7.  Chronic feelings of emptiness.\n    \n8.  Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g. - frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).\n    \n9.  Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.\n    \n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**IMPULSIVE**` can be used to remember the criteria for borderline personality disorder.\n\n*   `**I**` - **Impulsive**: “Are you by nature an impulsive person? (e.g. - shop lifting, binging, gaming)”\n    \n*   `**M**` - **Moodiness**: “Do you find it difficult to control your emotions?”\n    \n*   `**P**` - **Paranoia** or dissociation under stress: “Do you ever feel you dissociate or feel things aren't real during stress (e.g. - zoning out, feeling like in a dream, or feeling the world around you isn't real)?”\n    \n*   `**U**` - **Unstable self-image**: “Do you feel that you have a poor sense of who you are and your identity?” “How would you describe yourself as a person?” “What are you interests?” “Ever have uncertainty about sexual orientation?” “What are your values as a person?”\n    \n*   `**L**` - **Labile intense relationships**: “Are your romantic relationships intense, where people can be amazing one moment but awful the next?”\n    \n*   `**S**` - **Suicidal gestures**: “Do you self-harm?”\n    \n*   `**I**` - **Inappropriate anger**: “Are you quick to anger?”\n    \n*   `**V**` - **Vulnerability to abandonment**: “Is it hard for you when people in your life leave you? Do you have a constant fear of being abandoned by others?”\n    \n*   `**E**` - **Emptiness**: “Do you frequently feel empty inside?” (Emptiness is a unique feeling in BPD - either you have it or you don't)\n    \n\n##### Functional Neuroimaging[](#functional-neuroimaging)\n\n**Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)** has the most robust evidence for the treatment of borderline personality disorder.

Mirtazapine, however, is an _antagonist_ of postsynaptic 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, which reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms while lacking the side effects typically found with 5-HT activation (like with SSRIs).[\\[17\\]](#refnotes:1:note17)\n\n### Obstetric and Fetal[](#obstetric-and-fetal)\n\n**[6)](#refnotes:1:ref6)** [Radhakishun, F.

There is some evidence for a linear relationship between serum divalproex level and therapeutic efficacy in treating acute mania, with higher levels associated with greater efficacy.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n#### Valproic Acid Serum Target Levels[](#valproic-acid-serum-target-levels)\n\n| Indication | Level |\n| --- | --- |\n| Epilepsy | 50-100 mcg/mL |\n| Acute mania | 50-100 mcg/mL (350-700 mM/L) |\n| Maintenance | Unknown (maintain within accepted laboratory values) |\n| Toxicity | \\>175 mcg/mL |\n\n#### What Time Should the Bloodwork Be Done?[](#what-time-should-the-bloodwork-be-done)\n\nPlasma valproic acid levels should be taken 10–14 hours (ideally 12 hours) after the last dose. **Therefore, your patients should not be taking it the morning of the bloodwork!** They can take their dose again after their blood work.\n\n#### Valproic Acid Monitoring[](#valproic-acid-monitoring)\n\n| Stage of Treatment | Everyone | High Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pre-treatment | • CBC, platelets  <br>• Fasting glucose, fasting lipid profile (TC, LDL, HDL, TG)  <br>• Electrolytes, calcium  <br>• Liver enzymes, albumin, bilirubin (LFTs), PT/PTT, Cr (eGFR)  <br>• TSH  <br>• Baseline ECG  <br>• Baseline weight  <br>• Pregnancy test (if female), prolactin |     |\n| Starting | • Check VPA level, CBC, LFTs after 1 week of treatment  <br>• Then check again at 1 to 2 months (or when patient's symptoms stabilize) |     |\n| Maintenance | • CBC, platelets q6 months  <br>• LFTs, platelets q6 months  <br>(don't forget albumin!) | • CBC, platelets q3 months  <br>• LFTs, platelets q3 months  <br>(don't forget albumin!) |\n| Surgery or Acute Mental Status Change | • Serum drug levels, ammonia levels |     |\n| If hypoalbuminemia at any point\\* | • Draw a free level of valproic acid instead of total level |     |\n| Stopping | • Taper slowly over the course of 1 month |     |\n\n### Total and Free Levels[](#total-and-free-levels)\n\n#### What's the Difference Between Free and Total Valproic Acid Levels?[](#whats-the-difference-between-free-and-total-valproic-acid-levels)\n\n*   Remember that valproic acid is highly protein bound and binds strongly to albumin (almost 90% of it sticks to albumin). This means it's the remaining 10% of free floating valproic acid that exerts the therapeutic effect, NOT the valproic acid that is albumin-bound.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n    \n*   Thus, if a patient has hypoalbuminemia (low albumin), this means there will be much more free floating active valproic acid; this can increase the risk for toxicity!\n    \n*   The usual valproic acid level reflects the total level, thus may not be accurate if someone is hypoalbuminemic. Therefore, you will want to specifically order a free valproic acid level to see how much of the free-floating valproic acid is actually there!\n    \n\n#### Drug-Drug Interactions[](#drug-drug-interactions-1)\n\n| Drug | Interaction |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Carbamazepine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/carbamazepine \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:carbamazepine\") | Valproic acid will ↑ levels of carbamazepine |\n| [Lamotrigine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/lamotrigine \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:lamotrigine\") | Valproic acid can increase lamotrigine plasma levels significantly by inhibiting lamotrigine’s glucuronidation.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) This effect of valproate is dose-dependent. There is an increased risk of skin rashes, which requires close monitoring.[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) |\n\nApproximately 25% of patients can develop a tremor within the first year of starting treatment.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7) There is a dose-response relationship. Reducing the dose or a change to a slow‐release formulation can improve symptoms. Alternatively, [carbamazepine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/carbamazepine \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:carbamazepine\") can be used in patients who experience significant tremors.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8)\n\nThere is an increased prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) associated with valproic acid, and this has been reported in both women with epilepsy and bipolar disorder.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)\n\nValproate hepatotoxicity varies in severity from transient asymptomatic ALT elevations to severe toxicity with jaundice, hepatic synthetic dysfunction, coma and death. Monitoring of symptoms and serum aminotransferase levels is recommended for children for the first 6 months of valproate therapy.\n\nDrug-induced acute pancreatitis can occur. It does not depend on the serum level and can occur at any time after the onset of therapy.[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)\n\nNeutropenia can occur.\n\nUp to a quarter of individuals on valproic acid may experience temporary alopecia (hair loss), most commonly associated with long-term valproate pharmacotherapy. It appears to be dose-related and may be more common in women than in men.[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)\n\nAll antiepileptics are associated with reductions in bone density in postmenopausal women and men older than 65 years. Adverse effects on bone metabolism (particularly [phenytoin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/phenytoin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:phenytoin\")) are also seen in younger patients. The mechanisms behind bone loss behind cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (e.g. - phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine) are thought to be due to accelerated inactivation of vitamin D which decreases calcium uptake, drives secondary hyperparathyroidism and accelerates bone loss. It is unclear how non cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (e.g. - valproic acid) reduce bone mineral density and increase the risks of fractures. However, valproic acid has been associated with fractures due to the development of hypophosphatemia secondary to Fanconi syndrome.[\\[12\\]](#refnotes:1:note12)\n\nWeight gain has been found to occur in 57% of adults and 58% of older children and teenagers.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13)\n\nValproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) is an unusual complication characterized by a decreasing level of consciousness, focal neurological deficits, cognitive slowing, vomiting, drowsiness, and lethargy.[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15) Blood ammonia levels should be measured in patients with new onset neurological symptoms as it can be due to hyperammonemic encephalopathy, even when valproate levels are in the normal range and liver function tests are normal.\n\n### Obstetric and Fetal[](#obstetric-and-fetal)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Schwartz, T.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-tremors","markdown":"**Tremors** are rhythmical, involuntary oscillatory movements of a body part. The most common tremors are enhanced physiologic tremors, followed by essential tremor, and parkinsonian tremors. Tremors also become more common with age.\n\nTremors can be classified as a resting tremor and/or action tremor.\n\n1.  A **resting tremor** occurs in a body part that is not voluntarily activated and is completely supported against gravity. Rest tremors become more prominent with mental stress/distraction (e.g. - counting backward) or movement of another body part (e.g. - walking). When the affected body part engages in voluntary movement, the tremor will often diminish. Resting tremors are most commonly caused by parkinsonism or [Parkinson's Disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/parkinsons \"geri:dementia:parkinsons\"), but may also occur in severe essential tremor.\n    \n2.  An **action tremor** is any tremor that is produced by voluntary contraction of muscle. There are several types of action tremors, including postural, isometric, and kinetic tremor. The latter includes intention tremor.\n    \n\n#### Resting Tremor[](#resting-tremor)\n\n| Type | Description | Physical Exam | Possible Etiologies |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Resting | A tremor that occur only when the body part is at rest and completely supported against gravity | Rest arms on lap or chair while supported. | • Parkinson's Disease  <br>• Drug-induced parkinsonism (e.g. - antipsychotics)  <br>• Supranuclear palsy |\n\n#### Action Tremor Types[](#action-tremor-types)\n\n| Type | Description | Physical Exam | Possible Etiologies |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Postural | Occurs when the body part is voluntarily maintained against gravity. | Ask patient to hold out their arms | • Normal (physiologic) tremor  <br>• Sleep deprivation  <br>• Cerebellar  <br>• Dystonic  <br>• Drugs (excessive caffeine/nicotine use)  <br>• Alcohol withdrawal  <br>• Increase metabolic states (hyperthyroidism)  <br>• Essential tremor |\n| Kinetic | Occurs with any form of voluntary movement. | Ask patient to move the affect limb during finger-to-nose testing | Essential, cerebellar, dystonic, or drug-induced tremors. |\n| Intention | A subtype of a kinetic tremor.

Sympathomemetics and psychotropic medications (e.g. - SSRIs, antipsychotics, and TCAs) in particular may increase the risk. Antipsychotics in particular may cause tremors (parkinsonism) as a result of [extrapyramidal symptoms](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\"). Also, [akathisia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps#akathisia \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") should be in the differential for patients with complaints of tremor. Drug-induced tremors are usually bilateral.\n\nMetabolic causes of tremor are varied. Initial workup of tremor may include blood testing for hepatic encephalopathy, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and [vitamin B12 deficiency](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/vitamin-b12-cyanocobalamin-deficiency \"cl:vitamin-b12-cyanocobalamin-deficiency\").\n\nThe classic cerebellar tremor is a disabling, low-frequency, intention or postural tremor, and is typically caused by multiple sclerosis with cerebellar plaques, stroke, or brainstem tumors. Other physical exam findings include dysmetria (seen as overshooting on finger-to-nose testing), dyssynergia (abnormal heel-to-shin testing), and/or hypotonia.\n\n**Psychogenic tremors** can be difficult to diagnose. They usually have an abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Often, there is an associated stressful life events. If patients are on psychotropic medications, [akathisia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps#akathisia \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") should be in the differential and not missed (especially if they are on an antipsychotic).\n\n#### Features of psychogenic tremors[](#features-of-psychogenic-tremors)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| • Abrupt onset  <br>• Absence of other neurologic signs  <br>• Changing tremor characteristics  <br>• Clinical inconsistencies  <br>• Employed in allied health professions  <br>• Litigation or compensation pending  <br>• Multiple somatizations  <br>• Multiple undiagnosed conditions  <br>• No evidence of disease by laboratory or radiologic investigations | • Presence of psychiatric disorder  <br>• Presence of secondary gain  <br>• Reported functional disturbances in the past  <br>• Responsive to placebo  <br>• Spontaneous remission  <br>• Static course  <br>• Tremor increases with attention, and lessens with distractibility  <br>• Unclassified tremor (complex tremors)  <br>• Unresponsive to antitremor medications |\n\nWilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that can sometimes present with a “wing-beating” tremor.\n\nA good history is key to determining the cause and type of tremor the patient has.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps","markdown":"**Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)** are drug-induced movement disorders that occur due to [antipsychotic](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\") blockade of the nigrostriatal dopamine tracts. These blockades can lead to increased cholinergic activity, resulting in acute dystonia, acute akathisia, antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia (TD), tardive dystonia, and tardive akathisia.\n\nThe **extrapyramidal** and **pyramidal** tracts are the pathways by which motor signals are sent from the brain to lower motor neurones. The lower motor neurones directly innervate muscles to produce movement. The **pyramidal tracts** are involved in _conscious_ control of muscles from the cerebral cortex to the muscles of the body and face. The **extrapyramidal tracts** (called “extra” to distinguish it from the tracts of the motor cortex that reach their targets by traveling through the pyramids of the medulla) originate in the brainstem, and carry motor fibres to the spinal cord. These tracts are responsible for the _unconscious_, reflexive or responsive control of musculature (e.g - muscle tone, balance, posture and locomotion). The reticulospinal tract is one of the most important extrapyramidal tracts for controlling the activity of lower motor neurons.\n\n##### Risk Factors[](#risk-factors)\n\nAntipsychotic naive individuals, the elderly, and those with intellectual disability are at greater risk for developing EPS.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) In particular, elderly females are more likely to develop drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, while young ethnic males are more likely to develop dystonic reactions.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n#### Rating Scales for EPS[](#rating-scales-for-eps)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Extrapyramidal Rating Scale (ESRS) | Clinician | The ESRS is the most comprehensive rating scale as it assesses for all types of EPS, while the other scales only assess for one domain. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/esrs.pdf \"meds:antipsychotics:esrs.pdf (94.5 KB)\") |\n| Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) | Clinician | The AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of tardive dyskinesia (specifically, orofacial movements and extremity and truncal movements) in patients taking antipsychotic medications. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/aims.pdf \"meds:antipsychotics:aims.pdf (60.9 KB)\") |\n| Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) | Clinician | The SAS is an established instrument for antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/sas_simpson_angus_scale_modified.pdf \"meds:antipsychotics:sas_simpson_angus_scale_modified.pdf (120.5 KB)\") |\n| Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) | Clinician | The BARS is the most commonly used scale to measure antipsychotic-induced akathisia in clinical trials. | [Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/bars_barnes_akathisia.pdf \"meds:antipsychotics:bars_barnes_akathisia.pdf (58.1 KB)\") |\n\n**Acute dystonia** is an acute movement disorder that can result from antipsychotic use. It occurs more commonly with typical antipsychotics, and can affect 3 to 10% of individuals. It can occur either immediately or within days of starting an antipsychotic. Acute dystonia is characterized by sustained contractions of the neck, orofacial muscles, or tongue (i.e. - opisthotonos, torticollis). When identified, it can be easily treated with an anticholingeric such as [benztropine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/anticholinergic/benztropine \"meds:anticholinergic:benztropine\") and will resolve.\n\n#### Confusing Terminology Alert![](#confusing-terminology-alert)\n\nDystonia can be both acute or tardive, therefore, you can have both acute and tardive dystonia (tardive dystonia is less common and much rarer).

My uneasiness soon began to focus on the idea that I could not possibly sit for the rest of the experiment. I imagined walking outside; the idea of walking was particularly attractive. I could not concentrate on what I had been reading. As soon as I could move, I found myself pacing up and down the lab, shaking and wringing my hands. Whenever I stopped moving, the anxiety increased. I imagined bicycling home rapidly - the thought of rapid motion was again appealing. I gladly washed a large pile of dishes that were not mine–normally not my favorite activity. Two features of this akathisia reaction impressed me. First, the intensity of the dysphoria was striking. Second, the sense of a foreign influence forcing me to move was dramatic. Long before I thought of akathisia, or even discovered that moving made me less anxious, I was pacing and wringing my hands. **Had I been asked why I was behaving this way, I can imagine I would have looked at my hands and feet and responded “I don't know.”** The sense of a foreign force driving one to move, with the concomitant anxiety, might be extremely disconcerting to an uninformed patient who is already struggling with psychosis.”_\n\n– [Kenneth S. Kendler, 1976 (after receiving 1mg IM haloperidol in an experiment)](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.133.4.454-a \"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.133.4.454-a\")\n\n##### Pathophysiology[](#pathophysiology1)\n\n##### Scale[](#scale)\n\n##### Physical Exam[](#physical-exam)\n\n##### Differential Diagnosis[](#differential-diagnosis)\n\nThe differential diagnosis for akathisia is broad and includes:\n\n##### Management[](#management)\n\n#### Treatment for Akathisia[](#treatment-for-akathisia)\n\n**Parkinsonism** is a clinical syndrome comprised primarily of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. The most common cause of parkinsonism is Parkinson disease, but parkinsonism also can occur because of the use of antipsychotics (more accurately referred to as medication-induced Parkinsonism, or pseudoparkinsonism, since the symptoms are _not_ from a true Parkinson's Disease). It usually appears within a few days of starting treatment, or may evolve slowly over several weeks. Other causes of parkinsonism include [Lewy Body Dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/lewy-body \"geri:dementia:lewy-body\"), Wilson's disease, substance abuse, or Huntington disease, and must be ruled out.\n\nSymptoms are similar to Parkinson's Disease, including bradykinesia, mask-like face, cogwheel rigidity, and tremors. [Tremors](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-tremors \"neurology:approach-tremors\") are considered a cardinal sign of antipsychotic-induced Parkinsonism.[\\[18\\]](#refnotes:1:note18) Other features of drug-induced parkinsonism include increased salivation, drooling, seborrhea, and postural instability. Approximately 40% of older patients treated with typical antipsychotics can develop drug-induced parkinsonism even at low doses.[\\[19\\]](#refnotes:1:note19) Atypical antipsychotics have a lower incidence of causing parkinsonism.\n\n##### Pathophysiology[](#pathophysiology2)\n\nThe blockage of D2 receptors by antipsychotic drugs in the striatum is thought to lead to disinhibition of GABA and encephalin-containing striatal neurons in the _indirect_ pathway without affecting the _direct_ pathway in the basal ganglia, along with by disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus. The change in the output of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loop, is similar to changes seen in [Parkinson disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/parkinsons \"geri:parkinsons\").[\\[20\\]](#refnotes:1:note20)\n\n[Benztropine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/anticholinergic/benztropine \"meds:anticholinergic:benztropine\") is commonly prescribed, but its use should be limited to short-term use, as there are significant adverse effect associated with long-term anticholinergic use, including: tachycardia, memory loss, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation. This is especially common in older patients. In general, the evidence is poor for the use of benztropine, though it is commonly used.\n\n**Tardive dyskinesias (TD)** are involuntary movements of the muscles of the face, mouth, and tongue that are referred to as _orofacial dyskinesias_. These are repetitive oral, facial, and tongue movements that can resemble grimacing, chewing, lip smacking, tongue protrusion. The estimated prevalence of TD from exposure to antipsychotics is estimated to be 30% with first-generation antipsychotics, and 20% with second-generation antipsychotics.\n\n“The history of tardive dyskinesia holds many instructive lessons regarding long-term adverse drug effects. First described in the late 1950s shortly after the introduction of antipsychotics, it took many years before its prevalence, incidence, and long-term course were well investigated. At first there was [resistance and skepticism from many quarters](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/pharmaceutical-industry-influence \"teaching:pharmaceutical-industry-influence\") as to the risk of this condition and its apparent association with long-term exposure to antipsychotic medication… Some might argue that it was until the threat of litigation became more and more a reality that clinical practice included adequate consideration of and monitoring for tardive dyskinesia.”[\\[24\\]](#refnotes:1:note24)\n\n– John M. Kane, M.D.\n\n##### Pathophysiology[](#pathophysiology3)\n\nChronic blockade of dopamine receptors (in the nigrostriatal pathway) by antipsychotics results in dopamine receptor hypersensitivity and up-regulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors.[\\[25\\]](#refnotes:1:note25)[\\[26\\]](#refnotes:1:note26) The increase in dopamine receptors means there is hyperinhibition of the _stop_ signal, in conjunction with unopposed _go_ signals in the post-synaptic receptor. This is thought to generate the hyperkinetic movements observed in TD. Of note, this remains a theory and research is still ongoing. However, it remains a useful pathophysiological explanation for the development of tardive dyskinesias.\n\nTardive dyskinesia movements can often be revealed or amplified by an activation technique since many patients need to be distracted before the disorder will visually manifest. For example, ask the patient to keep their mouth open for 20 to 30 seconds, then ask them hold up their hand while tapping each finger to the thumb in sequence. Another clinical exam is to ask the patient to open and close each hand while the mouth is open. This allows one to observe any curling or writhing movements of the tongue.[\\[27\\]](#refnotes:1:note27) TD can persist even after discontinuing treatment, hence, it is very important to monitor for early signs of TD using the [Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)](#abnormal-involuntary-movement-scale-aims \"meds:antipsychotics:eps ↵\").\n\nThe Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a rating scale that was designed in the 1970s to measure involuntary movements known as tardive dyskinesia (TD).\n\n#### EPS (Tardive Dyskinesia) Monitoring[](#eps-tardive-dyskinesia-monitoring)\n\n| Name | Rater | Description | Download | Video |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) | Clinician | The AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of dyskinesias (specifically, orofacial movements and extremity and truncal movements) | [AIMS Download](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/side-effects/aims.pdf \"meds:side-effects:aims.pdf (41.8 KB)\") | [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfUsIPaLCs \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfUsIPaLCs\") |\n\n#### Do not use benztropine to treat TD![](#do-not-use-benztropine-to-treat-td)\n\nBenztropine should only be used for treatment of acute dystonia and Parkinsonism.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia","markdown":"**Aphasia** is a disturbance of language due to brain damage. This damage can affect comprehension (listening and reading) and/or expression (speaking and writing). In aphasia, the ability is name objects is always impaired to some degree. Aphasia most commonly develops after a brain injury, such as a stroke or head trauma. However, it can also develop due to neurodegenerative diseases, such as [Alzheimer’s disease](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/alzheimers \"geri:dementia:alzheimers\") or [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\"), leading to syndromes such as [primary progressive aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa \"geri:dementia:primary-progressive-aphasia-ppa\").\n\n#### How Do I Test for Dysarthria?[](#how-do-i-test-for-dysarthria)\n\nDysarthria is predictable pattern of typical difficulty with pronunciation of a sound. To test for dysarthria, ask the patient to say a word several times repeatedly. Some common words (the NIH Stroke Scale/Score \\[NIHSS\\] Dysarthria Words) used to test for dysarthria include:\n\n*   `MAMA`\n    \n*   `TIP-TOP`\n    \n*   `FIFTY-FIFTY`\n    \n*   `THANKS`\n    \n*   `HUCKLEBERRY`\n    \n*   `BASEBALL PLAYER`\n    \n\nWhen we say someone has normal speech or fluency in a neurologic/psychiatric context, it means they have good phrase length, rate, and an abundance of spontaneous speech. It also means they have no paraphasic errors (inappropriately substituted words or syllables), no neologisms (nonexistent words), and no errors in grammar. Normal prosody is a term also frequently used, meaning there is normal range of rhythm, pitch, stress, intonation.\n\n#### Foreign Accent Syndrome[](#foreign-accent-syndrome)\n\nAcquired Neurogenic Foreign Accent Syndrome (ANFAS) is a motor speech disorder in which, after brain damage such as a traumatic brain injury or stroke, patients start speaking with a new accent, which sounds like a foreign accent to listeners. This typically occurs after damage to the language-dominant, left hemisphere (affecting the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex, the internal capsule, the corona radiata, or the basal ganglia nuclei).[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) Although impaired expression of emotion through pitch, loudness, rate, and rhythm of speech can occur after right-hemisphere (RH) strokes, these rarely result in FAS.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\nWhen speech is impaired and not normal, it is called aphasic speech. Aphasias are first categorized as either fluent or non-fluent. They can then be further sub-characterized by whether there are deficits in repetition, comprehension, and naming.\n\n#### Syntax Errors and Semantic Errors[](#syntax-errors-and-semantic-errors)\n\n*   A **syntax (or synatactic) error** is a violation of the _grammatical rules_ of a language\n    \n    *   e.g. - “I _is_ going to the store.”\n        \n    *   e.g. - “people elderly” instead of “elderly people”\n        \n*   A **semantic error** is a violation of the _rules of meaning_ of a language.\n    \n    *   e.g. - “My _banana_ just flew a _car_ to Chicago”\n        \n    *   e.g. - “time-telling thing” instead of “watch”)\n        \n    *   Although the syntax (grammar) above is perfectly correct, the semantics (meaning) does not make sense!\n        \n\n#### Is it Aphasia or Something Else?[](#is-it-aphasia-or-something-else)\n\nKeep in mind that aphasia is a separate disorder from dysarthria, an impairment of the _motor_ functions of speech (i.e. - the actual muscles involved in speech). To distinguish aphasia from dysarthria, remember that aphasia by definition requires difficulties with naming (e.g. - naming common daily objects).\n\n#### Aphasia Syndromes[](#aphasia-syndromes)\n\nN = Normal or relatively spared, Imp = Impaired, \\* = with paraphasia, † = with echolalia\n\n| Aphasia | Fluency | Repetition | Comprehension | Naming |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Broca's (Expressive) | _Imp_ | _Imp_ | **N** | _Imp_ |\n| Transcortical Motor | _Imp_ | **N** | **N** | _Imp_ |\n| Mixed Transcortical | _Imp_† | **N** | _Imp_ | _Imp_ |\n| Global | _Imp_ | _Imp_ | _Imp_ | _Imp_ |\n| Wernicke's (Receptive) | **N**\\* | _Imp_ | _Imp_ | _Imp_ |\n| Transcortical Sensory | **N**† | **N** | _Imp_ | _Imp_ |\n| Conduction (Arcuate) | **N**\\* | _Imp_ | **N** | _Imp_ |\n| Anomic | **N** | **N** | **N** | _Imp_ |\n\n [![Fluent and Non-Fluent Aphasias](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/approaches/aphasia.png?w=400&tok=ba81e5 \"Fluent and Non-Fluent Aphasias\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/approaches/aphasia.png \"neurology:approaches:aphasia.png\") Fig. 1 : Fluent and Non-Fluent Aphasias[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/neurology/approaches/aphasia.png)\n\nNon-fluent aphasias usually involve damage or a lesion affecting the _anterior_ portion of the language centre in the left hemisphere.\n\n_The patient knows what they want to say, but struggles to get it out._\n\n**Broca's Aphasia** (also known as “expressive aphasia”) is often referred to as a non-fluent aphasia because of the halting and effortful quality of speech.\n\n**Transcortical Motor Aphasia** is a type of of non-fluent aphasia similar to Broca's aphasia, but repetition skills are intact. The deficit is usually due to a small subcortical lesion superior to Broca's area, or the anterior superior frontal lobe in the perisylvian area of the left hemisphere.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) The patient may have difficulty spontaneously answering a question but can repeat long utterances without difficulty.\n\n**Mixed Transcortical Aphasia** is a combination of the two transcortical aphasias ([transcortical motor aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia#transcortical-motor-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\") and [transcortical sensory aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia#transcortical-sensory-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\")), where both reception and expression are severely impaired. Repetition remains intact.\n\n**Global Aphasia** is a non-fluent aphasia with severe impairment of both expressive and receptive skills (hence the term global). This aphasia is usually associated with a large left hemisphere lesion that affects both the receptive (Wernicke's) and expressive (Broca's) areas of the brain. Despite these deficits, individuals may be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonations.\n\nFluent aphasias usually involve damage or a lesion affecting the _posterior_ portion of the language centre in the left hemisphere.\n\n_The patient can speak effortlessly, but the speech lacks meaning, and they cannot understand the written or spoken language._\n\n**Wernicke's aphasia** (also known as “receptive aphasia”) is a fluent aphasia where the ability to grasp the meaning of spoken/written words is impaired, but fluent speech is still produced. However, this _does not_ mean spoken speech is normal by any means. Although the speech is fluent (i.e. - smooth), there are paraphasias such as jumbled words and meaningless sentences. An individual may be unable to understand spoken or written words, or may read and not understand what they are reading. Sometimes, an individual pretends to understand and even nods in agreement, known as “cover-up aphasia.”\n\n**Transcortical Sensory Aphasia** is similar to Wernicke's aphasia, with the exception of a strong ability to repeat words and phrases. The patient may repeat questions rather than answer them (also known as “echolalia”).\n\n**Conduction Aphasia** is a fluent aphasia with a significant impairment with repetition. The lesion involves the arcuate fasciculus and the left parietal region. The patient can express themselves reasonably well, with some word-finding issues, and comprehension can be good. However, the patient will show significant difficulty repeating phrases, particularly as they increase in length and complexity. They may stumble over words they are attempting to pronounce.\n\n**Anomic Aphasia** is a fairly mild form of aphasia. The patient will use generic fillers, such as nonspecific nouns and pronouns (e.g., “thing”), or circumlocution, where the person describes the intended word in a roundabout way. Comprehension and repetition is typically intact, but the patient may not always recognize the retrieved word is the correct one, indicating difficulty with word recognition as well.\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Knecht, S., Dräger, B., Deppe, M., Bobe, L., Lohmann, H., Flöel, A., ... & Henningsen, H.

The unacceptable emotion is reversed and experienced consciously as its opposite. This defense is different from undoing because the original emotion was never consciously experienced – it becomes the opposite before it becomes conscious, and thus doesn’t have to be “undone.” Jane the stepmother treats a stepchild with excessive nurturing and overprotection. However, she unconsciously resents the child. [Histrionic personality disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/personality/histrionic \"personality:histrionic\") **Repression** Involuntarily/unintentionally blocking upsetting feelings from entering the consciousness. Repression hides thoughts, feelings, and fantasies from consciousness, leading to forgetting and/or denial. Contrast this to suppression, which is the voluntary blocking of upsetting feelings (more adaptive). John does not remember going to family counselling during his parents' divorce 20 years ago. - **Turning against the self** This defense substitutes the self for the object, particularly when it comes to negative affects. John was angry at his father for buying a new car rather than paying for his college education. Later in the school year, he is angry at himself for not doing as well as he could have during the semester. - **Identification** The ‘“if you can’t beat them, join them” defense. Feelings such as jealousy and competitiveness are dealt with by internalizing aspects of the other person. Identification can be quite adaptive, for example when someone works in a productive way to emulate a mentor. Identification is a normal and important part of development during adolescence. A medical student struggling in medical school starts talking in mannerisms similar to another medical student who is more academically successful. **Excessive emotionality** Thought content is repressed while affect remains present. This is a defense that is opposite of intellectualization and isolation of affect. Sometimes the high affect (emotion) substitutes for a repressed thought, while other times, it substitutes for another, even more anxiety-provoking emotion. Instead of telling her husband she was fired from her job, Jane cried for hours unconsolably. [Histrionic personality disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/personality/histrionic \"personality:histrionic\") **Sexualization** An individual take issues that are not sexual and makes them sexual to avoid deeper uncomfortable feelings. Adrift during her mother’s death, Jane began to flirt with her male trainer to avoid thinking about her mother. [Histrionic personality disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/personality/histrionic \"personality:histrionic\") **Externalization** People perceive internal conflicts as if they were external conflicts. Jane debates with her therapist about whether she should stay with her current boyfriend, after an ex-boyfriend texts her. Several months into therapy, she realizes she was ambivalent about getting married to her boyfriend in the first place (regardless of if the ex-boyfriend had texted or not). -"}

It emphasizes ways in which past experiences shape present situations. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves the exploration of transference (feelings that the patient has toward another person which they unconsciously redirect toward the therapist) to explore unresolved issues.

Thank you for supporting our site!\n\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy is indicated when a patient's problems are linked to unconscious factors that lead to interpersonal difficulties, maladaptive ways of coping with stress, and/or distorted self-perceptions. Generally speaking, individuals with depression, anxiety, certain personality disorders, or trauma may be suitable for psychodynamic therapy.\n\n#### Psychoanalysis vs. Psychodynamic[](#psychoanalysis-vs-psychodynamic)\n\nPsycho_analytic_ theory and psychoanalysis refers to the original perspective and theoretical ideas proposed by [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud\"). Psycho_dynamic_ theory and psycho_dynamic_ therapy refers to the later ideas and perspectives that originated from Sigmund Freud and his followers since then. These two terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nThere are several theories as to why psychodynamic therapy is efficacious as a treatment modality, including:\n\n1.  **Making the unconscious conscious**: that unconscious thoughts and feelings affect and motivate people, and becoming aware of these thoughts is therapeutic. It allows the patient to better know themselves, and releasing these unconscious ideas can be cathartic\n    \n2.  **Supporting weakened ego function**: psychodynamic therapy helps patient by supporting their ego function (you will learn more about this in the sections below)\n    \n3.  **Reactivating mental and emotional development**: psychodynamic therapy can reactivate a patient's mental and emotional development, which leads to new and healthier growth. Examples include developing new ways of thinking about themselves, relating to others, and developing more adaptable and flexible coping skills/mechanisms\n    \n\nPsychodynamic therapy is effective and has modest to large effect sizes for common mental disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) Psychodynamic therapy should not be limited to adults, and can be used in children (e.g. - play therapy) and adolescents as well.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\nIn psychodynamic psychotherapy, the human mind can be thought of as three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. Unlike contemporary neuroscience, these are not anatomical regions of the brain, but rather a conceptual idea.\n\n#### The Mind: Id, Ego, Superego[](#the-mind-id-ego-superego)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Id  | Wishes and desires |\n| Ego | Manages inner mental life and relationship to the outer environment (the world) |\n| Super-Ego | Conscience and personal ideals |\n\nSince the _ego_ mediates between the desires of the _id_ and the _super-ego_, it needs tools to do this mediation. These tools are called _ego functions_, and helps an individual modulate their responses to both internal and external stimuli. Some ego functions protect us from external environment stimuli, while other ego functions protect us from inner stimuli. Ego functions include:\n\nNot everyone has strong ego functions (i.e. - some people have weak ego function or “weak tools”). They may have poor tolerance, poor relationship with others, and/or difficulty with reality testing. Part of psychotherapy is helping you strengthen these functions. Individuals with strong ego functions are said to have good ego strength.\n\n**Defense mechanisms** are an important part psychodynamic therapy. Defenses are thoughts and behaviors (both voluntary or involuntary) that an individual uses to resolve conflict and prevent undesirable feelings (e.g. - depression). Learning to identify and understand defenses is important in psychodynamic psychotherapy.\n\nFor a beginner, a psychotherapy patient should:[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)\n\nThe first few sessions of psychotherapy typically focus on understanding and taking a good relationship history, from childhood up to adulthood. Here are some key topics that need to be addressed during the first session:\n\n#### Educate Your Patient on Psychodynamic Therapy![](#educate-your-patient-on-psychodynamic-therapy)\n\nIt can be helpful to first ask your patient what they think psychotherapy is. The following educational pieces might also be helpful for your patient to know:\n\n*   Every session is different\n    \n*   Important to attend each session\n    \n*   Non-judgmental space, confidential space, to help you understand yourself\n    \n*   Can really talk about whatever, this full hour is your time\n    \n*   It’s okay to be off-topic, the idea is “free association”\n    \n*   You should walk out of a session emboldened, and feel better\n    \n*   Even if you think there’s nothing to talk about, there’s something to talk about\n    \n*   Sometimes might have things to say about _this_ relationship (the therapist-patient relationship), and that’s okay!\n    \n*   Let me know if you feel like things are helping, or things are not working and you would like to see it changed\n    \n*   Psychodynamic therapy can take many years\n    \n*   “You can’t leave somewhere you haven’t arrived at yet”\n    \n\nAt a certain point, you will have collected enough social history, and it is time to transition and let your patient know that the therapy will become much less structured. For example, to start this session, you can tell them “I'd like you to talk about whatever comes to your mind, and I will stop taking notes.” It is usually better to not take notes, so your patients are able to freely associate, and reduce biasing your patients in talking about what they think _you_ want to hear.\n\n#### What Do I Say? What Do I Not Say?[](#what-do-i-say-what-do-i-not-say)\n\nPsychodynamic therapy can be challenging for the novice practitioner due to the lack of structure, and the requirement of having the patient lead the session. Here are some tips to guide you:\n\n*   If a patient asks: “Should I be feeling this way?” or “Is it normal to feel this way?,” you can validate and say “There are no shoulds or shouldn'ts with feelings. They just are. Feelings make sense.” The same would go for questions like: “Am I over-reacting?” You should tell your patients to show some compassion to themselves for having anger.\n    \n*   When there is a deafening silence during a session, it's okay to say something like “talk about what feels important to you”\n    \n*   If a patient is very self-critical about a situation or themsleves, it maybe appropriate to probe further and ask: “you seem to be very self-critical about \\[situation\\], why?”\n    \n\nThe following diagram ([figure 1](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychotherapy/psychodynamic/home#img_fig1)) helps illustrate some of the principles described here to visualize just how a psychotherapy session might work:\n\n [![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/psychodynamic/psychodynamic_simplified.png?w=950&tok=5ae94c)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/psychodynamic/psychodynamic_simplified.png \"psychotherapy:psychodynamic:psychodynamic_simplified.png\") Fig. 1: Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Visualized[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/psychotherapy/psychodynamic/psychodynamic_simplified.png)\n\nEvery psychodynamic therapy relationship with a patient has 4 phases:\n\n#### Four basic phases of psychotherapy[](#four-basic-phases-of-psychotherapy)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Evaluation | The initial assessment and history-taking phase |\n| Induction | Beginning the treatment, developing therapeutic relationship, setting goals, helping patient learn to use therapy |\n| Mid-phase | Majority of treatment time is spent here: the therapist and patient work together to achieve the therapeutic goals set during the induction phase |\n| Termination | Ending of the treatment: goals are consolidated, treatment is reviewed, the change that has occurred is appraised and role of future change is also evaluated, planning for future therapy, and termination of relationship |\n\n## Tips and Techniques[](#tips-and-techniques)\n\nPsychodynamic therapy is by definition very unstructured, but there are certain techniques that are frequently employed,[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) the main ones are:\n\n##### 1\\. Listening: Hear Your Patient[](#listeninghear-your-patient)\n\nYou listen to the content of their speech for particular themes, conflicts, and of course, their concerns. Listen for slips, also known as pararaxes, affects, free associations, transference, defences, unconscious fantasies, and dreams.\n\n##### 2\\. Reflecting: Process What They Say[](#reflectingprocess-what-they-say)\n\nAfter you have heard you patient, you need to process this information and understand its meaning. By understanding, you can decide you to respond and intervene. This process is called reflecting. First, let's go back to key idea of psychodynamic therapy: _unconscious ideas affect conscious thoughts_. Using this principle, this means you need to reach the unconscious thoughts first. This is why listening is so key: you listen for clues on the surface, to guide you to deeper towards unconscious thoughts.\n\nAll the material that patients give us is helpful in doing that. When reflecting, it is important to attend to three ideas: going from the superficial ideas to deep, identifying which topics contain the most affect (emotion) for the patient, and acknolwedging your counter-transferance (what feelings do you, as the therapist, have towards you patient? – are you reacting strongly to something a patient said because of your own biases/idiosyncrasies?)\n\n##### 3\\. Intervening: Respond to What They Say[](#interveningrespond-to-what-they-say)\n\nHow do you know what to say or if the patient is ready for it? There are 3 principles you can use:\n\n1.  What is the therapeutic alliance? Therapeutic alliance is the amount of trust between a patient and a therapist. Alliance builds over time as therapists show their patients that they understand them. A strong therapeutic alliance allows a therapist to say things that might otherwise be quite painful to a patient had they heard it from the therapist the first time they met.\n    \n2.  What is the phase of the treatment? There are 3 phases to psychodynamic therapy: the beginning, the mid-phase, and the termination phase. The further a long a patient is in therapy, the easier it is for the therapist to make certain comments or observations\n    \n3.  And what is the patient's ego function? Is it important to constantly reassess your patient's ego function, as it will change and fluctuate depending on whether they are regressing, under stress, or medically ill.\n    \n\n**Pathological accommodation** refers to ways of being that function unconsciously to preserve a needed [attachment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/child/attachment/1-theory \"child:attachment:1-theory\") when that bond has been traumatically threatened. In this sense of the word, “accommodation” means that the individual unconsciously adopts the views and feelings of another at the expense of his or her own experience.[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\n\n##### Books[](#books)\n\n##### Websites[](#websites)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Abbass, A.

MI is a collaborative, goal-oriented method of communication with a focus on the language of _change_. MI is used when the therapist wants to strengthen an individual’s motivation for a goal by eliciting and exploring the person’s own arguments for/against change. In MI, the therapist assumes a non-judgmental stance, acknowledges ambivalence, focuses on the patient's motivation for change, and also tolerates resistance to change. MI can also be integrated within other psychotherapies, such as [cognitive behavioural therapy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychotherapy/cbt \"psychotherapy:cbt\").\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n[![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/amazon_aff/mi.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3SePd6t)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3SePd6t)\n\nPsychDB is an Amazon Associate and earns from qualifying purchases.

While there _may_ be some indication for long-term use of benzodiazepines for _certain_ individuals, most individuals on benzodiazepines do not need to be on it long-term! Studies showing the long-term efficacy of benzodiazepines are lacking. When tapering benzodiazepines, consider the duration of treatment, the dose, and the half-life of the benzodiazepine. If the patient has been on the benzodiazepine for more than 12 weeks, one may want to taper at a rate of 10 to 25% per week. Towards the later part of the taper, the taper should be slowed down more.\n\nSome individuals on benzodiazepines for prolonged periods of time may meet criteria for a [benzodiazepine use disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/addictions/sedative-hypnotics/1-use-disorder \"addictions:sedative-hypnotics:1-use-disorder\"). It is thus important to ask about other benzodiazepine or sedative hypnotic use (prescribed, non-prescribed, recreational), and other substance use.\n\nSeveral jurisdictions and organizations have published recommendations on how to switch/taper benzodiazepines.\n\n#### Guidelines[](#guidelines)\n\nWithdrawal management alone is unlikely to lead to sustained abstinence from benzodiazepines. Psychosocial treatment is just as important! If patients were on a benzodiazepine for an underlying psychiatric disorder, these psychiatric disorders must also be treated, or the risk of benzodiazepine use will be extremely high again.\n\n### Articles[](#articles)"}
{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cognitive-testing/moca","markdown":"The **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)** is a brief cognitive screening test with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting [Mild Neurocognitive Disorder / Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/3-mild-neurocog-disorder \"cl:3-mild-neurocog-disorder\"). The MoCA is particularly useful for detecting cognitive changes in those with higher levels of education, or where mild cognitive changes are the primary clinical concern.\n\n#### Download MoCA[](#download-moca)\n\n#### Download Alternate Versions[](#download-alternate-versions)\n\nThe MoCA is best used for screening for [mild neurocognitive disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/3-mild-neurocog-disorder \"cl:3-mild-neurocog-disorder\") (i.e. - mild cognitive impairment). Cognitive tests are **not** diagnostic, and require interpretation by a clinician in conjunction with other factors, including a patient's clinical history, risk factors, and investigations.\n\n## Components and Scoring[](#components-and-scoring)\n\nAll instructions in the MoCA may be repeated only once. The instructions and scoring below are described for MoCA version 7.1.\n\nInstruct the patient: “_Please draw a line going from a number to a letter in ascending order. Begin here \\[point to (1)\\] and draw a line from 1 then to A then to 2 and so on. End here \\[point to (E)\\]_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring)\n\n*   `1` point is given if the patient successfully draws the following pattern: 1→A→2→B→3→C→4→D→5→E, without drawing any lines that cross\n    \n*   Any error that is not immediately self-corrected (meaning corrected before moving on to the Cube task) earns a score of 0.\n    \n*   A point is also not given if the patient draws a line to connect the end (E) to the beginning (1)\n    \n\nPoint to the drawing, instructing: “_Copy this drawing as accurately as you can_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-1)\n\n`1` point is allocated for a correctly executed drawing. A point is not assigned if any of the below criteria are not met:\n\n*   Drawing must be three-dimensional\n    \n*   All lines are drawn\n    \n*   All lines meet with little or no space\n    \n*   No line is added\n    \n*   Lines are relatively parallel and their length is similar (rectangular prisms are accepted)\n    \n*   For the cube drawing, the cube’s orientation in space must be preserved\n    \n\nEnsure that the subject does not look at his/her watch while performing the task and that no clocks are in sight. The examiner indicates the appropriate space and gives the following instructions: “_Draw a clock. Put in all the numbers and set the time to 10 past 11_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-2)\n\n`1` point is allocated for each of the following `3` criteria:\n\n*   **Contour** (1 point): the clock contour must be drawn (either a circle or a square). Only minor distortions are acceptable (e.g. - slight imperfection on closing the circle). If the numbers are arranged in a circular manner but the contour is not drawn the contour is scored as incorrect\n    \n*   **Numbers** (1 point): all clock numbers must be present with no additional numbers. Numbers must be in the correct order, upright and placed in the approximate quadrants on the clock face. Roman numerals are acceptable. The numbers must be arranged in a circular manner (even if the contour is a square). All numbers must either be placed inside or outside the clock contour. If the subject places some numbers inside the clock contour and some outside the clock contour, (s)he does not receive a point for Numbers.\n    \n*   **Hands** (1 point): there must be two hands jointly indicating the correct time. The hour hand must be clearly shorter than the minute hand. Hands must be centered within the clock face with their junction close to the clock center.\n    \n\nInstruct the patient by beginning on the left, and point to each figure and say: “_Tell me the name of this animal_”.\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-3)\n\n`1` point each is given for the following responses (for version 7.1):\n\n1.  Camel or dromedary\n    \n2.  Lion\n    \n3.  Rhinoceros or rhino\n    \n\nRead a list of 5 words at a rate of 1 word per second, giving the following instructions: “_This is a memory test. I am going to read a list of words that you will have to remember now and later on. Listen carefully. When I am through, tell me as many words as you can remember. It doesn’t matter in what order you say them_.” Mark a check in the allocated space for each word the subject produces on this first trial.\n\nWhen the subject indicates that (s)he has finished (has recalled all words), or can recall no more words, read the list a second time with the following instructions: “_I am going to read the same list for a second time. Try to remember and tell me as many words as you can, including words you said the first time_.” Put a check in the allocated space for each word the subject recalls after the second trial. At the end of the second trial, inform the subject that (s)he will be asked to recall these words again by saying, “_I will ask you to recall those words again at the end of the test_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-4)\n\n*   There is no scoring in this section.\n    \n*   The examiner cannot correct the subject if the subject recalls a word incorrectly, or if they substitute it for a similarly sounding word!\n    \n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-5)\n\n*   Allocate `1` point for each sequence correctly repeated.\n    \n*   The examiner cannot correct or remind the subject if the subject repeats the ‘backwards’ series of numbers in ‘forwards’ order!\n    \n\nRead the list of letters at a rate of one per second, after giving the following instructions: “_I am going to read a sequence of letters. Every time I say the letter A, tap your hand once. If I say a different letter, do not tap your hand_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-6)\n\nGive `1` point if there is zero to one errors (an error is a tap on a wrong letter or a failure to tap on letter A)\n\nGive the following instructions: “_Now, I will ask you to count by subtracting seven from 100, and then, keep subtracting seven from your answer until I tell you to stop_.” Give this instruction twice if necessary.\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-7)\n\nThis item is scored out of `3` points. Give no (`0`) points for no correct subtractions, `1` point for one correction subtraction, `2` points for two-to-three correct subtractions, and `3` points if the participant successfully makes four or five correct subtractions. Count each correct subtraction of 7 beginning at 100. Each subtraction is evaluated independently; that is, if the participant responds with an incorrect number but continues to correctly subtract 7 from it, give a point for each correct subtraction. For example, a participant may respond “92 –> 85 –> 78 –> 71 –> 64” where the “92” is incorrect, but all subsequent numbers are subtracted correctly. This is only considered one error and the item would be given a score of 3.\n\nGive the following instructions: “_I am going to read you a sentence. Repeat it after me, exactly as I say it_ \\[pause\\]: _I only know that John is the one to help today_.” Following the response, say: “_Now I am going to read you another sentence. Repeat it after me, exactly as I say it_ \\[pause\\]: _The cat always hid under the couch when dogs were in the room._”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-8)\n\nAllocate `1` point for each sentence correctly repeated. Repetition must be **exact**. Be alert for errors that are omissions (e.g. - omitting “only”, “always”) and substitutions/additions (e.g. - “John is the one who helped today;” substituting “hides” for “hid”, altering plurals, etc.).\n\nGive the following instructions: “_Tell me as many words as you can think of that begin with a certain letter of the alphabet that I will tell you in a moment. You can say any kind of word you want, except for proper nouns (like Bob or Boston), numbers, or words that begin with the same sound but have a different suffix, for example, love, lover, loving. I will tell you to stop after one minute. Are you ready? \\[Pause\\] Now, tell me as many words as you can think of that begin with the letter F._ \\[time for 60 sec\\]. _Stop_.”\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-9)\n\nAllocate `1` point if the subject generates 11 words or more in 60 seconds. Record the subject’s response in the bottom or side margins.\n\nAsk the patient to explain what each pair of words has in common, starting with the example: “_Tell me how an orange and a banana are alike_”. If the subject answers in a concrete manner, then say only one additional time: “_Tell me another way in which those items are alike_”. If the subject does not give the appropriate response (fruit), say, “_Yes, and they are also both fruit_.” Do not give any additional instructions or clarification. After the practice trial, say: “_Now, tell me how a train and a bicycle are alike_”. Following the response, administer the second trial, saying: “_Now tell me how a ruler and a watch are alike_”. Do not give any additional instructions or prompts.\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-10)\n\nOnly the last two item pairs are scored. Give `1` point to each item pair correctly answered. The following responses are acceptable:\n\n*   Train-bicycle = means of transportation / means of travelling / you take trips in both ( = they have wheels, is not acceptable)\n    \n*   Ruler-watch = measuring instruments / used to measure ( = they have numbers, is not acceptable)\n    \n\nGive the following instructions: “_I read some words to you earlier, which I asked you to remember. Tell me as many of those words as you can remember_.“ Make a check mark for each of the words correctly recalled spontaneously without any cues, in the allocated space.\n\n#### Optional Step[](#optional-step)\n\nFollowing the delayed free recall trial, prompt the subject with the semantic category cue provided below for any word not recalled. Make a check mark in the allocated space if the subject remembered the word with the help of a category or multiple-choice cue. Prompt all non-recalled words in this manner. If the subject does not recall the word after the category cue, give him/her a multiple choice trial, using the following example instruction, “_Which of the following words do you think it was, NOSE, FACE, or HAND?_” Use the following category and/or multiple-choice cues for each word, when appropriate:\n\n*   **FACE**: category cue: part of the body multiple choice: nose, face, hand\n    \n*   **VELVET**: category cue: type of fabric multiple choice: denim, cotton, velvet\n    \n*   **CHURCH**: category cue: type of building multiple choice: church, school, hospital\n    \n*   **DAISY**: category cue: type of flower multiple choice: rose, daisy, tulip\n    \n*   **RED**: category cue: a colour multiple choice: red, blue, green\n    \n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-11)\n\n*   Allocate `1` point for each word recalled freely without any cues.\n    \n*   No points are allocated for words recalled with a cue. A cue is used for clinical information purposes only and can give the test interpreter additional information about the type of memory disorder. For memory deficits due to retrieval failures, performance can be improved with a cue. For memory deficits due to encoding failures, performance does not improve with a cue.\n    \n\n#### Clinical Correlation Required[](#clinical-correlation-required)\n\nIf the patient can recall words with multiple choice or category cues, then it suggests the words were encoded in the hippocampus, but unable to be retrieved. This would suggest a frontal lobe deficit, more commonly seen in [vascular dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/vascular \"geri:dementia:vascular\"), [frontotemporal dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/frontotemporal \"geri:dementia:frontotemporal\"), or [Parkinson’s dementia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/dementia/parkinsons \"geri:dementia:parkinsons\").[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\nAllocate `1` point for each word recalled freely without any cues.\n\n#### Scoring[](#scoring-12)\n\n*   Give `1` point for each item correctly answered. The patient must tell the exact date and the exact place (name of hospital, clinic, office). No points are allocated if the patient makes an error of one day for the day and date.\n    \n\nSum all subscores listed on the right-hand side. Add `1` point for an individual who has 12 years or fewer of formal education, for a possible maximum of 30 points. A final total score of `26` and above is considered normal.\n\n#### MoCA Cognitive Domains and Neuroanatomy[](#moca-cognitive-domains-and-neuroanatomy)\n\n| Category | Test | Cognitive domain | Neuroanatomical region |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Visuospatial/Executive | Trails | Executive function | • Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC)  <br>• Trail making requires cognitive flexibility generated through the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortices.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) |\n| Visuospatial/Executive | Cube | • Executive function  <br>• Visual/spatial perception, construction praxis | • Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  <br>• Right parietal lobe |\n| Visuospatial/Executive | [Clock drawing](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cognitive-testing/clock-drawing-test \"cognitive-testing:clock-drawing-test\") | • Constructional praxis  <br>• Executive function | • Right parietal lobe  <br>• Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex |\n| Naming | Animals | • Semantic knowledge  <br>• Vocalization and articulation | • Anterior temporal lobes (bilateral)  <br>• Broca’s area and insular cortex |\n| Memory | 5 word repeat | Working memory | Anterior temporal lobes (bilateral) |\n| Attention | Digit list | Attention/vigilance | Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex |\n| Attention | Tapping | Response inhibition | Orbitofrontal cortex |\n| Attention | Serial 7s | Working memory, attention, calculation | Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left parietal lobe |\n| Language | Sentence repeat | • Working memory/executive function  <br>• [Aphasia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/approach-aphasia \"neurology:approach-aphasia\") | Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex |\n| Language | Fluency (F-words in 1 minute) | • Working memory/executive function  <br>• Phonemic fluency | Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex |\n| Abstraction | Similarities | Conceptualization, abstract thinking, higher level thinking | Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex |\n| Delayed Recall | 5 word delayed recall | Memory | Hippocampus |\n| Orientation | Date, time, place | Memory | Hippocampus |\n\nSuggested cut-off scores by the creator of the MoCA, are as follows:[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\n#### MoCA Cut-off Scores[](#moca-cut-off-scores)\n\nNasreddine, Ziad S., et al.

Its use has expanded to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders in recent years.\n\n#### SSRIs, SNRIs, NDRIs, MAOIs, TCAs... What Do I Use?![](#ssris-snris-ndris-maois-tcas-what-do-i-use)\n\nIn terms of safety profile and prescribing practices, most clinicians now prescribe SSRIs, SNRIs, and other newer agents. Newer antidepressants generally have a better tolerability and safety profile. However, several decades ago, TCAs and MAOis were the predominant antidepressants. These medications remain effective for the treatment of depression, but are no longer in widespread use due to the narrow therapeutic index for TCAs, and the diet-restriction that is required with MAOi use (to prevent hypertensive crises). Experienced clinicians will be familiar using all classes of antidepressants and tailoring it to specific patient needs. **The best antidepressant is the one that the patient actually uses.**\n\n#### Common Antidepressant Choices[](#common-antidepressant-choices)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Escitalopram | Low side effect profile, good for treatment with comorbid medical illness.[\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14) Commonly prescribed in primary care settings. Unfortunately it has a narrow dose range (maximum 20mg), due to increased risk of QTc prolongation at higher doses. This means you can only increase the dose so much before needing to switch to another antidepressant if there is no response. |\n| Sertraline | Good for patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Indicated as a first-line medication for not just depression, but also generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder and other disorder. Sometimes felt by clinicians to be more sedating than other SSRIs, but the research evidence does not necessarily demonstrate this.[\\[15\\]](#refnotes:1:note15) Sertraline has a higher incidence of GI side effects which can be mitigated by taking it with food, and with HS dosing, but this can be a reason for discontinuation. |\n| Fluoxetine | Another good first-line choice and very similar to sertraline, with less GI side effects. It has the added benefit of also treating any comorbid eating disorders. It also has a long half-life, which means very little chance of withdrawal symptoms even if it is discontinued abruptly. |\n\n### Neurotransmitters and Neuroreceptors[](#neurotransmitters-and-neuroreceptors)\n\n### Withdrawal and Discontinuation[](#withdrawal-and-discontinuation)\n\n## Side Effects and Adverse Events[](#side-effects-and-adverse-events)\n\nIn the elderly, falls can also be common with the use of SNRIs, TCAs, but less commonly in SSRIs.[\\[19\\]](#refnotes:1:note19)\n\n#### Study 329: A Story of Pharmaceutical Influence[](#study-329-a-story-of-pharmaceutical-influence)\n\nA re-analysis in 2015 of Study 329 on the efficacy and safety of [paroxetine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/paroxetine \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:paroxetine\") for children and adolescents showed that paroxetine was neither safe nor efficacious.[\\[50\\]](#refnotes:1:note50) In fact, there was significant harm exposed to children, including increased suicidal ideation and behaviour. This case is a reminder to clinicians of the large role that[pharmaceutical influence](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/pharmaceutical-industry-influence \"teaching:pharmaceutical-industry-influence\") still has on healthcare.\n\n#### Research Supporting Antidepressants in Reducing Suicide Risk[](#research-supporting-antidepressants-in-reducing-suicide-risk)\n\n#### Like All Things in Medicine, There Are Risks and Benefits![](#like-all-things-in-medicine-there-are-risks-and-benefits)\n\nThe role of SSRIs in mortality should continue to be investigated. Like all medications and medical procedures, there are risks and benefits that must be considered. A patient has a possibility of dying during an operation from not just the surgery itself, but also with general anesthetics. The current research evidence also suggests that for mild-moderate depression, medication and psychotherapy leads to the same rate of improvement. Therefore, it may make sense that the role of antidepressants should focus more on patients who are experiencing severe depression. Like with any medication, patients should be counselled on the risks and benefits of taking an antidepressant. It is undeniable that for many patients, short-term, judicious use of antidepressants leads to significant clinical improvements. What is more needed is the integration of psychotherapies and other non-pharmacological options to sustain recovery.\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### Articles[](#articles)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[11)](#refnotes:1:ref11)** [Warden, D., Rush, A.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home","markdown":"**Antipsychotics** (also known as **neuroleptics** or **major tranquilizers**) are a class of medications mainly used in the treatment of psychosis in [schizophrenia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/psychosis/schizophrenia-scz \"psychosis:schizophrenia-scz\") and psychosis/mania in [bipolar disorder](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/bipolar/bipolar-i \"bipolar:bipolar-i\"). Its use has expanded to neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders in recent years.\n\nOne theory in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is that increased dopamine activity causes the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Similar to how methamphetamine and cocaine also increases dopamine activity, and can cause schizophrenia-like symptoms. Therefore, antipsychotics target the mesolimbic pathway to decrease the incidence of positive symptoms. Antipsychotics work by binding to dopaminergic neuroreceptors. It is important to keep in mind that this is a _theoretical_ model, and that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains poorly understood.\n\nThere are **4** key dopaminergic pathways that antipsychotics affect (See also: [The Four Dopamine Pathways Relevant to Antipsychotics Pharmacology](https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/antipsychotics-videos/dopamine-pathways-antipsychotics-pharmacology/ \"https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/antipsychotics-videos/dopamine-pathways-antipsychotics-pharmacology/\")).\n\n [![The four key dopaminergic pathways of the brain](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/dopaminergic_pathways_of_the_brain_vertical_v3.png?w=1000&tok=eef3e2 \"The four key dopaminergic pathways of the brain\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/dopaminergic_pathways_of_the_brain_vertical_v3.png \"meds:antipsychotics:dopaminergic_pathways_of_the_brain_vertical_v3.png\") Fig. 1 : The four key dopaminergic pathways of the brain[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/antipsychotics/dopaminergic_pathways_of_the_brain_vertical_v3.png)\n\n#### The Four Key Dopamine Pathways[](#the-four-key-dopamine-pathways)\n\n| Pathways | Projection | Relevance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mesocortical | Ventral tegmental area → prefrontal cortex | Decreased dopamine leads to negative symptoms (amotivation, flat affect, anhedonia). Cognitive symptoms are also thought to be due to a hypoactive mesocoritcal pathway. |\n| Mesolimbic (reward) | Ventral tegmental area → nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. | Increased dopamine leading to positive symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia, delusions). Importantly, the mesolimbic pathway is the same pathway for nicotine-reward pathway. |\n| Nigrostriatal | Substantia nigra → striatum (caudate and putamen) | This pathway also gets blocked by antipsychotics, leading to [extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\"), such as tremors, slurred speech, dystonia, and other abnormal movements. Akathisia is another side effect. |\n| Tuberoinfundibular | Entirely in hypothalamus, from arcuate (infundibular) and periventricular nuclei to the median eminence. | The decrease of dopamine in this pathway, through the use of antipsychotics, can cause an increase prolactin ([hyperprolactinemia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/hyperprolactinemia \"meds:antipsychotics:hyperprolactinemia\")), leading to side effects like gynecomastia, galactorrhea, and menstrual irregularities. The regular role of dopamine release in the tuberoinfundibular pathway is to tonically inhibit prolactin release. |\n\nThe therapeutic action of an antipsychotic occurs when 65% to 85% of brain dopamine (D2) receptors are occupied.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) When more than 80% of the dopamine (D2) receptors are occupied, [hyperprolactinemia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/hyperprolactinemia \"meds:antipsychotics:hyperprolactinemia\") and [parkinsonism](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") can result. In addition to percentage occupancy, the duration of time that the antipsychotic drug stays attached to the D2 receptor impacts the degree of [extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\"). For example, haloperidol remains attached to the D2 receptor _in vitro_ for over 38 minutes. Atypicals like [clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\") and [quetiapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/6-quetiapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:6-quetiapine\") dissociate from the D2 receptor quickly, in about 15 seconds (this has been referred to the “kiss and run” hypothesis).[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) As a result, these rapidly dissociating atypical antipsychotics have a lower incidence of EPS. Of note, the serum level of antipsychotics do not correlate with brain occupancy due to the blood brain barrier.\n\nAntipsychotic function can best be understood by their degree of affinity for the dopamine receptor, or potency (i.e. - “how much of the drug you need to produce a clinical effect?”).[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) This can be seen in the actual dose of the antipsychotic itself (e.g. - the therapeutic dose of risperidone (high potency) is 2-3 mg, whereas quetiapine (low potency) can be up to 800 mg). The potency of an antipsychotic in particular can tell you its particular effects and side effects. For example, all low potency antipsychotics (regardless if it is an FGA or SGA) have a lower incidence of EPS. This is because all low potency antipsychotics are also more anticholinergic (i.e. - in addition to targeting the D2 receptor, they also have greater anti-muscarinic activity). This means low potency antipsychotics have “built-in” benztropine (an anticholinergic medication used in the treatment of EPS). Understanding the [pathophysiology of EPS](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") will also help one understand why benztropine is given, and why EPS occurs with high potency antipsychotics.\n\n#### Antipsychotic Potency Table[](#antipsychotic-potency-table)\n\n| Potency | [First Generation (Typical)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/first-gen-typical/home \"meds:antipsychotics:first-gen-typical:home\") | [Second Generation (Atypical)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/home \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:home\") |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **HIGH** | Haloperidol | Risperidone |\n|     | Flupenthixol | Paliperidone |\n|     | Fluphenazine |     |\n|     | Pimozide |     |\n| **MEDIUM** | Loxapine | Olanzapine |\n|     | Zuclopenthixol | Ziprasidone |\n|     | Perphenazine | Aripiprazole |\n| **LOW** | Chlorpromazine | Quetiapine |\n|     | Methotrimeprazine | Clozapine |\n|     |     | Amisulpride |\n\nThe first antipsychotics in the 1950s included chlorpromazine and haloperidol, and were called first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), or typical antipsychotics. Starting in the 1990s, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were released and marketed. SGAs, also called atypical antipsychotics, were initially thought to be more effective and have a better safety profile. However, the [landmark CATIE trial](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/landmark-studies \"teaching:landmark-studies\") later showed that SGAs were no more effective than FGAs, and that the benefits were mainly [promoted by pharmaceutical companies](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/pharmaceutical-industry-influence \"teaching:pharmaceutical-industry-influence\").[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8) At the time of their release, it was also thought that SGAs would cause less [extrapyramidal symptoms](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") (particularly tardive dyskinesia). This was also another initial reason behind categorizing antipsychotics as either typical (first generation) or atypical (second generation).\n\nThus, _generally_ speaking:\n\nAt the present time, the difference between first and second generation antipsychotics is based more on historical and pharmaceutical influence, rather than a black and white distinction. It is more important to look at an individual antipsychotic's potency, receptor profile, and pharmacokinetics, rather than if it is an FGA or SGA.\n\nAntipsychotics have a relatively quick onset of action and patients begin responding within 1 week.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9) Patients usually first have improved sleep due to the sedating effects of antipsychotics, followed by decreased anxiety occurs from resolution of the psychotic symptoms. Despite pharmaceutical company marketing, there is no evidence that first and second generation antipsychotics differ in efficacy. The only exception to this is clozapine, which is the gold-standard medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and has the lowest re-hospitalization rate compared to all other antipsychotics.\n\nw\n\nThe literature shows that clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications have the highest rates of prevention of relapse in schizophrenia.[\\[20\\]](#refnotes:1:note20) The risk of rehospitalization is about 20% to 30% for patients treated with long-acting injectable treatments compared with the oral equivalents.[\\[21\\]](#refnotes:1:note21) If a patient is doing well on an existing first-generation long-acting injectable, switching them to a second-generation LAI puts them at a higher risk of treatment discontinuation and weight gain.[\\[22\\]](#refnotes:1:note22)\n\nAntipsychotic polypharmacy (i.e. - taking more than 1 antipsychotic) is commonly seen, but really should not occur! Generally speaking, patients with antipsychotic polypharmacy should be transitioned to monotherapy treatment. Furthermore, changing to monotherapy does not compromise the clinical response.[\\[23\\]](#refnotes:1:note23) One recent cohort studies did show superiority of clozapine plus aripiprazole over clozapine alone.[\\[24\\]](#refnotes:1:note24) However, antipsychotic polypharmacy should always be a treatment of last resort.\n\nWhen switching from one antipsychotic to another, there is no difference in clinical outcomes (psychopathology, extrapyramidal symptoms, and adverse effects) between maintaining the patient on the old antipsychotic for a period of time and starting the new antipsychotic, versus stopping the old antipsychotic immediately and introducing the new antipsychotic.[\\[25\\]](#refnotes:1:note25)\n\nDiscontinuation of antipsychotics is often a patient request due to intolerable side effects from the medication. This can present as a challenging clinical decision.[\\[26\\]](#refnotes:1:note26) Rapid or abrupt antipsychotic discontinuation is one of the major reasons for symptom recurrence and readmission to hospital. Therefore, any discontinuation should be carefully monitored and tapered slowly. The abrupt withdrawal of clozapine has been associated with cholinergic rebound and rapid onset of psychosis.

The reason for many of the side effects associated with antipsychotics is because antipsychotics do not exclusively target the dopamine receptors, and other receptors are also targeted.\n\n#### Side Effects Associated with Antipsychotics[](#side-effects-associated-with-antipsychotics)\n\n| Side Effects | Description | Management |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Metabolic Syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/metabolic-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:metabolic-syndrome\") | Atypical antipsychotics can cause hypertension, high blood sugar, obesity, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels, resulting in metabolic syndrome. Patients on atypical antipsychotics should be routinely monitored with metabolic blood work. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/metabolic-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:metabolic-syndrome\") |\n| [Constipation](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/constipation \"meds:antipsychotics:constipation\") | Chronic antipsychotic use can lead to constipation, which can be severe. Constipation can be a serious and life-threatening issue for patients on [clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine#constipation \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\"). | First-line management and treatment includes the use of an osmotic agent, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), and/or a stimulant laxative such as senna. There is limited evidence for the use of surfactant agents (“stool softeners”) like docusate sodium for chronic constipation. These agents only lower the surface tension of stool, but are not effective at preventing and treating medication-induced constipation. Patients on [clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine#constipation \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\") need to have regular bowel monitoring as the risks of complications are higher! |\n| Sedation | Certain antipsychotics are more sedating than others. The degree of sedation depends on the affinity to the histamine (H1) receptor. Generally, low potency antipsychotics are more sedating than high potency ones, and atypicals are more sedating than typicals. The most → least sedating antipsychotics (by H1 receptor affinity) are: clozapine > olanzapine > quetiapine > risperidone.[\\[30\\]](#refnotes:1:note30) | Reduce dose or consider antipsychotic switch to a higher potency antipsychotic. |\n| [Hyperprolactinemia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/hyperprolactinemia \"meds:antipsychotics:hyperprolactinemia\") | Hyperprolactinemia can be completely asymptomatic or be very distressing to patients when they experience associated symptoms including: menstrual disturbances, anovulatory cycles, galactorrhea, impaired fertility, or sexual dysfunction. It is due to the blockade of the tuberoinfundibular pathway. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/hyperprolactinemia \"meds:antipsychotics:hyperprolactinemia\") |\n| [Amenorrhea](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/hyperprolactinemia \"meds:antipsychotics:hyperprolactinemia\") | In females, hyperprolactinemia can result in amenorrhea, potentially causing ovarian dysfunction or infertility. | Metformin can restore menstruation in obese women with amenorrhea by restoring sex hormone levels and decreasing insulin resistance.[\\[31\\]](#refnotes:1:note31) Asking for a menstrual history is thus important for females on antipsychotics. |\n| [Sexual Dysfunction](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/sexual-dysfunction \"meds:antidepressants:sexual-dysfunction\") | Sexual dysfunction is common condition in patients taking antipsychotics, and caused by hyperprolactinemia and dopamine blockade.[\\[32\\]](#refnotes:1:note32) It is also the most bothersome symptom for patients. Sildenafil can be prescribed as a treatment for sexual dysfunction. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/sexual-dysfunction \"meds:antidepressants:sexual-dysfunction\") |\n| Hypotension | Orthostatic hypotension can be common in atypical antipsychotics (ranging from paliperidone to clozapine). It is thought to be caused by anticholinergic effects and/or alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade.[\\[33\\]](#refnotes:1:note33) | Consider adjusting the dose, increasing hydration, or change to a less anticholinergic antipsychotic (i.e. switching from low potency to high potency) |\n| Tachycardia | Tachycardia can result from low potency antipsychotics that have a higher anticholinergic burden. | Consider adjusting the dose, or changing to a less anticholinergic antipsychotic. In severe cases, tachycardia can be treated with beta‐blocker |\n| [QTc Prolongation](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/qtc \"meds:qtc\") | Antipsychotic increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, through the blockade of potassium channels and prolongation of the QT interval (i.e. - cardiac re-polarization). Other mechanisms may be involved, including autonomic effects and inhibition of other ion channels. [Clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\") is also associated with myocarditis, which is not seen with other antipsychotics.[\\[34\\]](#refnotes:1:note34) | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/qtc \"meds:qtc\") |\n| SIADH and [Hyponatremia](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/hyponatremia \"cl:hyponatremia\") | In rare cases, antipsychotics can cause hyponatremia.[\\[35\\]](#refnotes:1:note35) Antipsychotics are thought to increase AVP release is increased despite normal plasma osmolality, resulting in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which can result in hyponatremia. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/hyponatremia \"cl:hyponatremia\") |\n| Sialorrhea (Hypersalivation) | Hypersalivation/sialorrhea is a common side effect related to clozapine use (but can also occur in other antipsychotics). Sialorrhea can range from being mildly uncomfortable drooling to potentially life-threatening conditions, such as parotitis, choking, and aspiration. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine#salivation-hypersialorrhea \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\") |\n\n#### Adverse Events Associated with Antipsychotics[](#adverse-events-associated-with-antipsychotics)\n\n| Side Effects | Description | Management |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") | Extrapyramidal side effects include acute dystonia, akathisia, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and tardive dystonia. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") |\n| [Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\") | NMS is a life-threatening idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotics characterized by fever, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. It is hypothesized to be due to excessive dopamine receptor blockade. Certain individuals may be at a higher risk for NMS. | See [main article](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\") |\n| Seizures | Both typicals and atypicals can lower the seizure threshold. With typicals, chlorpromazine has the highest risk of inducing seizures, while haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide and trifluoperazine are associated with a lower risk of seizure. With atypicals, clozapine is commonly associated with seizures, while risperidone has the lowest risk.[\\[36\\]](#refnotes:1:note36) | \\-  |\n\n#### Special Populations[](#special-populations-1)\n\n| Population | Considerations |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Elderly](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacology/geri \"meds:pharmacology:geri\") | **All** antipsychotic agents are associated with increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia.[\\[37\\]](#refnotes:1:note37) There is also an increased incidence of cerebrovascular events (e.g. TIAs, stroke) has been seen among elderly patients on antipsychotics.

However, recommend initiation at lowest dose (especially in patients with concurrent renal impairment). Asenapine, lurasidone, paliperidone, and risperidone should be avoided in those with severe hepatic impairment.[\\[39\\]](#refnotes:1:note39) |\n| [Pregnancy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacology/obstetric-and-fetal \"meds:pharmacology:obstetric-and-fetal\") | Only clozapine and lurasidone are FDA Risk Category B (safe for use in pregnancy, but limited human data available; use with caution). All other antipsychotics are FDA Risk Category C (not safe in pregnancy, use only if benefit outweighs risk). All antipsychotics are also proven, or presumed, to be excreted into breast milk. Breastfeeding while on antipsychotics is not recommended.[\\[40\\]](#refnotes:1:note40) |\n\nAn initially controversial paper came out in 2011 that suggested antipsychotics were linked to smaller gray matter volumes.[\\[41\\]](#refnotes:1:note41) Since then, there has been conflicting research on whether this is due to exposure to antipsychotic drugs versus the degenerative process behind psychosis.[\\[42\\]](#refnotes:1:note42)[\\[43\\]](#refnotes:1:note43) In 2020, the first randomized control trial showed that antipsychotics (olanzapine specifically) changes brain structure. After 36 weeks of olanzapine exposure, individuals experienced 1.2% loss of cortical volume, which is equal to twice the yearly loss of cortical thickness in older adults.[\\[44\\]](#refnotes:1:note44) However, structural MRI techniques do have inherent limitations, and they may not actually indicate unqualified tissue loss, and the findings from this RCT has also been challenged.[\\[45\\]](#refnotes:1:note45) Other neuroimaging studies have also shown reductions in brain volume associated with antipsychotic uses over time.[\\[46\\]](#refnotes:1:note46) Regardless, the results from this study should have clinicians consider the risks and benefits of antipsychotics, especially in patients without psychosis. Based on the research evidence of the last decade, there needs to be more urgent research on the long-term effects of antipsychotics on the brain. Interestingly, other studies have shown that even unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia also have thinner cortical volume.[\\[47\\]](#refnotes:1:note47)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Research[](#research)\n\n**[3)](#refnotes:1:ref3)** Schatzberg, AF, Nemeroff, C .

For example low salt diets, dehydration, drug-drug interactions (see below) and illnesses like Addison’s disease can lead to toxicity. Patients should be well-informed of these risk factors when starting treatment. **Also, always remember to treat the patient and not the number! Serum lithium concentrations do not always reliably correlate with the clinical severity of toxicity.**[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n#### Toxic Lithium Levels[](#toxic-lithium-levels)\n\n| Level (mmol/L) | Symptoms |\n| --- | --- |\n| \\>1.5 | • GI symptoms (anorexia, nausea and diarrhea)  <br>• CNS symptoms (muscle weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, coarse tremor and muscle twitching). |\n| \\>2.0 | • Blurred vision, confusion, slurred speech, unsteady gait.  <br>• Increased disorientation and seizures usually occur, which can progress to coma, and ultimately death.  <br>• Osmotic or alkaline diuresis can be used (not thiazide or loop diuretics, which would worsen symptoms!) |\n| \\>3.0 | • Severe toxicity, coma, cardiovascular collapse, death.  <br>• Peritoneal or hemodialysis is often used for emergency management. |\n\n## Dosing and Target Level[](#dosing-and-target-level)\n\n#### Dosing for Lithium[](#dosing-for-lithium)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Starting | • Outpatient: 300 mg PO daily for the first week  <br>• Inpatient: 600 mg PO daily for the first week and generally titrated more aggressively |\n| Titration | Increments of 300 to 600 mg each week during the titration phase |\n| Maximum | Typically does not exceed 2400 mg per day (though the lithium level is most important) |\n| Taper | See below |\n\n#### Lithium Levels[](#lithium-levels)\n\n|     | Level (mmol/L) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Maintenance/prophylaxis | 0.6 to 1.0 |\n| Acute bipolar mania/depression (<65 years) | 0.8 to 1.2\\* |\n| Acute bipolar mania/depression (>65 years) | 0.4 to 0.8 |\n| [Toxic levels](#toxicity-and-overdose \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:1-lithium ↵\") | \\> 1.5 mmol/L |\n\n#### Calculating the target dose[](#calculating-the-target-dose)\n\nTo calculate how much to increase a dose by, take the current dose the patient is at, and divide it over the current lithium level.

You would need to wait another 5 half-lives before measuring the trough levels again.\n\n#### What Time Should the Bloodwork Be Done?[](#what-time-should-the-bloodwork-be-done)\n\nLithium is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but has a long distribution phase. Plasma lithium levels should be taken 10–14 hours (ideally 12 hours) after the last dose. **Therefore, your patients should not be taking lithium the morning of the bloodwork!** They can take their dose again after their blood work.\n\n#### Lithium Monitoring[](#lithium-monitoring)\n\n| Stage of treatment | Everyone | High Risk/Geriatric |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pre-treatment | Cr (eGFR), BUN, TSH, total calcium, albumin, weight, height, blood pressure | ECG (cardiovascular risks or dysfunction), fasting glucose, lipid panel |\n| Starting | • Plasma lithium level 7 days after starting treatment (you are measuring the trough level, i.e. - **12 hours** after last dose, \\[though there is some debate on this[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6)[\\[7\\]](#refnotes:1:note7)\\]  <br>• Measure plasma lithium after another 7 days, and titrate dose as needed.  <br>• This q1-2 weekly monitoring should continue until you have 2 consecutive levels within the therapeutic range (0.8 to 1.2) for the same dosage | Start with a lower dose of lithium, with similar monitoring |\n| Ongoing | • Plasma lithium level, electrolytes, Cr (eGFR), TSH, BUN, q6-12 months.  <br>• Serum calcium, albumin, q1 year  <br>• Parathyroid hormone levels should be measured in patients with elevated calcium levels | Elderly, those with drug-drug interactions, existing renal impairment, or other illnesses should be monitored more closely. |\n| Stopping | Dose needs to be reduced slowly over the course of 1 month. Reductions in plasma level should not be > 0.2mmol/L each time you reduce the dose. |     |\n\n#### Never Discontinue Lithium Abruptly![](#never-discontinue-lithium-abruptly)\n\nDiscontinuing lithium abruptly or in less than 2 weeks, rather than tapering (> 2 weeks) doubles the risk of a recurrent mood episode in 1 year; and the risk increases by 20 times in 3 years. At least 1 month should be spent tapering off lithium.[\\[8\\]](#refnotes:1:note8) Abrupt discontinuation of lithium and may actually **exceed** that of the risk of the untreated disorder.[\\[9\\]](#refnotes:1:note9)[\\[10\\]](#refnotes:1:note10)[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11) The reason for this “rebound effect” remains (unfortunately) a poorly understood mechanism.\n\n#### Common Drug-Drug Interactions[](#common-drug-drug-interactions)\n\nAdapted from: Taylor, D. M. et al. (2018). The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry. John Wiley and Sons.\n\n| Drug | Examples | Interaction |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ACE Inhibitors | Captopril, cilazapril enalapril, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril and trandolapril | Reduces thirst which can lead to mild dehydration. Increases renal sodium loss leading to increased sodium re‐absorption by the kidney, resulting in an increase in lithium plasma levels. In the elderly, ACE inhibitors increase seven‐fold the risk of hospitalisation due to lithium toxicity. ACE inhibitors can also precipitate renal failure so, if co‐prescribed with lithium, more frequent monitoring of e‐GFR and plasma lithium is required. |\n| Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (ARBs) | Candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan and valsartan | Similar drug-drug interactions as with ACE inhibitors. |\n| Thiazide and Loop Diuretics | _Thiazide diuretics_: bendroflumethiazide, chlortalidone, cyclopenthiazide, indapamide, metolazone and xipamide  <br>_Loop diuretics_: bumetanide, furosemide and torasemide | Diuretics reduces the renal clearance of lithium. **Thiazide diuretics** have a much larger effect compared to **loop diuretics**. Lithium levels usually rise within 10 days of a thiazide diuretic being prescribed; the magnitude of the rise is unpredictable and can vary from an increase of 25% to 400%. Although there are case reports of lithium toxicity induced by loop diuretics, many patients can recieve this combination of drugs without apparent problems. |\n| NSAIDs / COX-2 Inhibitors | Aceclofenac, acemetacin, celecoxib, dexibuprofen, dexketofrofen, diclofenac, diflunisal, etodolac, etoricoxib, fenbufen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indometacin, ketoprofen, lumiracoxib, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, piroxicam, sulindac, tenoxicam and tiaprofenic acid | NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of renal prostaglandins, reducing renal blood flow, which increases renal re‐absorption of sodium and therefore lithium. The magnitude of the rise is unpredictable for any given patient; case reports vary from increases of around 10% to over 400%. |\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic)\n\nThe mnemonic `**LMNOP**` can be used to remember important side effects and adverse events related to lithium:\n\n*   `**L**` - **Lithium**\n    \n*   `**M**` - **Movement** (tremor)\n    \n*   `**N**` - **Nephrology** (kidney injury) and **nephrogenic** diabetes insipidus (thirst and urination)\n    \n*   `**O**` - **Hyp`O`thyroidism**\n    \n*   `**P**` - **Pregnancy** (Ebstein's anomaly)\n    \n\n### Hypercalcemia and Hyperparathyroidism[](#hypercalcemia-and-hyperparathyroidism)\n\n### Leukocytosis and Neutrophilia[](#leukocytosis-and-neutrophilia)\n\n#### Lithium is a Human Teratogen![](#lithium-is-a-human-teratogen)\n\nLithium is associated with cardiac malformations (in particular, Ebstein's anomaly) and increased birth weight.[\\[34\\]](#refnotes:1:note34) Every woman of child‐bearing age on lithium should be advised to use a reliable form of contraception.\n\n### Obstetric and Fetal[](#obstetric-and-fetal)\n\n##### For Patients[](#for-patients)\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Research/Case Reports[](#researchcase-reports)\n\n##### Contrarian Views[](#contrarian-views)\n\n**[3)](#refnotes:1:ref3)** Taylor, David.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-1-42","markdown":"A **Form 1** (_Application by Physician for Psychiatric Assessment_) is a provision under the [Ontario Mental Health Act](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/home \"teaching:on:mha:home\") that allows a physician to detain a patient for a psychiatric assessment for up to 72 hours at a [Schedule 1 Facility](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx \"http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx\"). A **Form 42** (_Notice to Person_) is always given to a patient to notify them that they are under a Form 1.\n\nSince a Form 1 is only for an _assessment_ and not an involuntary admission _per se_, the threshold to issue a Form 1 can be low. In order for a Form 1 to be valid, there needs to be evidence of two things: (1) a risk (harm to self, to others, or physical impairment) _and_ (2) evidence of a mental disorder that is related to (or causing) that risk. There does not need to be a pre-existing or formal psychiatric diagnosis for a Form 1 to be valid. A mental disorder is defined as any psychiatric disorder or neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders).\n\n#### Download Form 1 and 42[](#download-form-1-and-42)\n\n#### Quick Start Guide[](#quick-start-guide)\n\nMost physicians will issue a Form 1 based on Box A (“Serious Harm Test”) criteria. The patient must meet at least `1` out of 3 criteria:\n\n1.  **Harm to Self** (e.g. - suicide)\n    \n2.  **Harm to Others**\n    \n3.  **Physical Impairment** (e.g. - risk of death by not eating, kidney failure by not drinking, untreated infections, etc.)\n    \n\nIn addition to meeting at least `1` out of 3 criteria, the Form 1 can only valid if there is evidence of a _mental disorder_. This evidence is based on two “tests”:\n\n1.  **Past/Present Test (Risk)**, and\n    \n2.  **Future Test (Evidence of Mental Disorder)**\n    \n\n#### Box A Criteria: Past/Present Test and Future Test[](#box-a-criteria-past-present-test-and-future-test)\n\n| Test | What it means | “My own observations” | “Communication by others” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Past/Present Test (Risk) | • This is where you document the evidence of risk or dangerous behaviour | • **Think of this as the “History of Presenting Illness”**  <br>• Examination may (and can) be brief. (For example, if the patient is uncooperative or dismissive, can document this)  <br>• Again, evidence or even mentioning of mental disorder NOT required in this section  <br>• Mention any _dangerous behaviour_ or evidence of _inability to care for self_ as you are assessing the patient right now  <br>• **Example**: Patient screaming at nurse and pacing down hallway | • **Think of this as the “Past Psychiatric History”**  <br>• Now you can talk about the condition/diagnosis.  <br>• What will happen in the future if the patient is not detained?  <br>• **Example**: Past diagnosis of schizophrenia, admitted to psychiatric unit in 2010, past history of suicide attempts as documented in chart |\n| Future Test (Evidence of Mental Disorder) | • This is where you document the evidence to support findings of a mental disorder that is causing the risk you mentioned | • **Think of this as the “Mental Status Exam”**  <br>• Use psychiatric terms here!  <br>• **Example**: Endorsing auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, responding to internal stimuli, active suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, thought blocking, paranoid delusions, hopelessness, depressed, etc… | **Think of this as the “Collateral History”**  <br>• This is information communicated to you by family, police, ER staff, friends, community supports, etc.  <br>• Document findings from others that suggest risk to self, others, or inability to care for self (e.g. - suicidal behaviour or ideation, violent behaviour or threats, and not caring for self to point of danger)  <br>• **Example**: Mother reports patient attempted to hang self last night |\n\nThe Box B Criteria is more complicated in an ER setting and therefore not commonly completed. In order to meet Box B criteria, the patient **must** have previously received treatment for the same or similar mental disorder in the past, and they must be presenting with symptoms suggestive of that same or similar mental disorder _right now_. Additionally, they must also have a history of improvement with treatment and evidence that they are likely to improvement with treatment again. Finally, the individual must also have a finding of incapacity and their substitute decision maker (SDM) must also have consented to treatment (i.e. - you have contacted the SDM). The eligibility threshold for Box B is thus much higher compared to Box A. In Box A, a patient needs to pose a serious and imminent risk to themselves or others. With Box B criteria, you must always do a [capacity assessment](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity \"teaching:on:consent-capacity\") and have a finding of incapacity (i.e. - also issue a [Form 33](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-33 \"teaching:on:mha:form-33\")).\n\nIn order for a patient to meet Box B criteria, they must meet **all** of the criteria set out in each of the following conditions.\n\n1.  Has previously received treatment for mental disorder of an ongoing or recurring nature that, when not treated, is of a nature or quality that likely will result in 1 or more of the following: (`1` or more):\n    \n2.  **AND** has shown clinical improvement as a result of the treatment\n    \n3.  **AND** the physician is of the opinion that the person, is incapable, within the meaning of the Health Care Consent Act, 1996, of consenting to his or her treatment in a psychiatric facility and the consent of his or her substitute decision-maker has been obtained\n    \n4.  **AND** is apparently suffering from the same mental disorder as the one for which he or she previously received treatment or from a mental disorder that is similar to the previous one\n    \n5.  **AND** given the person’s history of mental disorder and current mental or physical condition, is likely to: (choose 1 or more of the following):\n    \n\n#### When Do You Use Box B Instead of Box A?[](#when-do-you-use-box-b-instead-of-box-a)\n\n*   Prevents a “revolving door” effect of chronically ill patients going in and out of hospital\n    \n*   Decrease the seriousness of deterioration – a patient can be admitted when they start showing early signs and symptoms of illness\n    \n*   Prevents patients “falling through the cracks”\n    \n\n#### Paperwork Tips[](#paperwork-tips)\n\n**Form 1**\n\n*   The original copy of the Form 1 stays in the patient's chart; the patient does not get the Form 1\n    \n*   If the patient is transferred to another hospital, the Form 1 goes with the patient during the transfer\n    \n\n**Form 42**\n\n*   The original Form 42 is given to the patient (this is their legal document)\n    \n*   A photocopy of the Form 42 stays in the patient's chart\n    \n\n#### Sitters and Passes[](#sitters-and-passes)\n\nOn medical/surgical floors, a constant sitter must be ordered because the hospital is legally responsible for keeping the patient in hospital. Patients on a Form 1 _are_ allowed on passes outside if deemed appropriate. They can also be refused passes. This depends on hospital policy, and is not dictated specifically under the Mental Health Act.\n\n#### The Form 1 Only Allows for Detention, Not Treatment[](#the-form-1-only-allows-for-detention-not-treatment)\n\nThe Form 1 only allows for the physical detention of an individual. It does not allow you to force treatment without a patient's consent. Only emergency treatment is allowed in the event of significant morbidity or mortality. Therefore, if there is no emergency and a patient refuses treatment, you must respect the wishes of the patient even if they are on a Form 1. **However**, if a patient on a Form 1 is found incapable (i.e. - given a [Form 33](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-33 \"teaching:on:mha:form-33\")), and this is _not_ appealed by the patient, you can start involuntary treatment.\n\n#### You cannot sign both a Form 1 and a Form 3 for the same patient![](#you-cannot-sign-both-a-form-1-and-a-form-3-for-the-same-patient)\n\nIf you are the physician who signed the Form 1, you **cannot** sign a subsequent Form 3 for that patient. It must be a different MD, who makes a separate assessment to determine the involuntary admission. This allows the patient to have a second opinion assessment.\n\n#### What if the Form 1 is Filled Incorrectly?[](#what-if-the-form-1-is-filled-incorrectly)\n\nThere can be implications to filling out a Form 1 incorrectly, including the potential for a $25,000 fine for knowingly contravening the Mental Health Act. Plus, the patient could be considered to be detained “illegally” (thus leading to the potential for civil suit, though this is rare). Therefore, if you notice the Form 1 is filled out incorrectly by another physician, you need to re-do the Form 1 correctly under _your_ name. The maximum time of detention remains 72 hours regardless of when you noticed the error (i.e. - you cannot add another 72 hours at the time you correct the form. You must respect of the spirit of the Form 1!). IF you feel the patient continues to meet criteria for involuntary admission, the _best practice_ should be to re-do a correct Form 1 plus a [Form 3](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-3 \"teaching:on:mha:form-3\") immediately afterwards (with a DIFFERENT MD signing, since you cannot sign both the Form 1 and Form 3) so a patient is not issued a Form 1 twice.\n\n#### What if a Patient AWOLs on a Form 1?[](#what-if-a-patient-awols-on-a-form-1)\n\n*   Only physicians who have seen the patient in the past 7 days can fill out a new Form 1 again to request the police apprehend the patient\n    \n    *   This time on the Form 1, Leave the “For Use at the Psychiatric Facility” section blank\n        \n*   Police then need to be called and the Form 1 is given to the police while they search for the patient\n    \n*   If you issue a Form 1 on Wednesday January 1st, the police have until end of Tuesday January 7th 23:59h (that's 7 days) to make the apprehension, **not** the next Wednesday (that would be 8 days)\n    \n\n#### When Someone is Under a Form 1: Can I Break Confidentiality and Speak to a Friend or Family Member?[](#when-someone-is-under-a-form-1-can-i-break-confidentiality-and-s)\n\nYes. The Ontario Mental Health Act allows for a health care provider to speak with friends or family members of the patient.\n\n*   Specifically, when an individual is detained under the Mental Health Act: “the officer in charge of a psychiatric facility may collect, use and disclose personal health information about a patient, **with or without the patient’s consent**, for the purposes of examining, assessing, observing or detaining the patient” or as part of complying with the Criminal Code of Canada or “an order or disposition.”[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n    \n*   Although you should always try to respect the patient's wishes if they do not wish have personal information disclosed, you can most certainly obtain information from a family member or friend for the purposes of doing your [assessment and examination](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/1-psych-interview \"teaching:1-psych-interview\").\n    \n\n#### Common Form 1 Errors[](#common-form-1-errors)\n\n*   The Form 1 instructions tell you to complete either Box A **OR** Box B, do not complete both boxes! Many MDs overlook this and end up completing both Box A and Box B. Do not do this! Pick Box A (most likely) or Box B, but never both!\n    \n*   You must make sure you check off the **SAME** criteria for both the Past/Present and Future Test. (i.e. - do not check off “harm to self” under Past/Present Test, but then check off “harm to others” under the Future Test)\n    \n*   Remember the Form 1 has **3** areas where you need to sign\n    \n*   Remember the Form 1 has **3** areas where you write the **DATE** (Jan 1) and the **TIME** (1000h)\n    \n\nA **Form 42** (_Notice to Person under Subsection 38.1 of the Act of Application for Psychiatric Assessment under Section 15 or an Order under Section 32 of the Act_) is given to a patient to notify them you are detaining them under a Form 1. This must be given to the patient immediately if the patient is in a [Schedule 1](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx \"http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx\") Facility. If they are not in a Schedule 1 Facility, then the Form 42 can be delayed and issued to the patient once they arrive at a Schedule 1 Facility and are assessed by a physician.\n\n#### When Do You Give The Patient The Form 42?[](#when-do-you-give-the-patient-the-form-42)\n\nThree scenarios are possible:\n\n*   **Patient in emergency room at a Schedule 1 Facility**: MD issues the Form 1 and Form 42 at the same time. Thus, the signing and detention time is also the same\n    \n*   **Patient in emergency room at a non-Schedule 1 Facility**: MD issues the Form 1, and patient awaits transfer to schedule 1 Facility. Form 42 is issued only on arrival to the Schedule 1 Facility. The signing and detention time are thus different.\n    \n*   **Patient in outpatient office**: The outpatient MD issues a Form 1, but **cannot and does not** give the patient the Form 42, because the patient is not yet detained in a [Schedule 1 Facility](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx \"http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/psych/designated.aspx\"). Only when the patient is at the facility does the _receiving_ MD assess the patient, fill out a Form 42, and issue it to the patient. If you are _receiving_ MD, you write the name of the _issuing_ physician on the Form 42 (NOT your name), but you _sign_ the Form 42 with your signature. Yes, it's _that_ confusing!\n    \n\n##### Legal[](#legal)"}

A Form 3 lasts 2 weeks.\n\n#### Download Form 3[](#download-form-3)\n\n#### Example[](#example)\n\nThe date the Form 3 expires is always 13 days later (or “two weeks minus a day”), and **not** 14 days, because you _always_ include the day the Form was filled.\n\n*   Date Form 3 filled: January 1\n    \n*   Date Form 3 expires: January 14\n    \n\n#### You cannot sign a Form 1 and a Form 3 for the same patient![](#you-cannot-sign-a-form-1-and-a-form-3-for-the-same-patient)\n\nIf you are the physician who signed the Form 1, you **cannot** sign a Form 3. It must be a different MD, who makes a separate assessment to determine the involuntary admission. This allows the patient to have a second opinion assessment.\n\n#### The Form 3 Only Allows for Detention, Not Treatment[](#the-form-3-only-allows-for-detention-not-treatment)\n\nThe Form 3 only allows for the physical detention of an individual. It does not allow you to force treatment without a patient's consent. Only emergency treatment is allowed in the event of significant risk for morbidity or mortality. Therefore, if there is no emergency and a patient refuses treatment, you must respect the wishes of the patient even if they are on a Form 3.\n\nA patient can be in a situation where they detained on a Form 3, but found to be capable. If found capable by the [consent and capacity board](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity-board-hearings \"teaching:on:consent-capacity-board-hearings\"), a patient has a right to refuse treatment. Under that circumstance, only a finding of incapacity under the Health Care Consent Act (HCCA) would allow you to treat the patient. As an example, a patient with schizophrenia can be detained under a Form 3 for risk of serious physical impairment, but still be capable to make a decision to refuse an antipsychotic.\n\n##### Legal[](#legal)"}

You should make sure you:\n\n#### Types of Homework Assignments[](#types-of-homework-assignments)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Behavioural Activation | Getting active, depressed patients out of bed or off the couch, and helping them resume normal activity |\n| Monitoring automatic thoughts | From the first session forward, you will encourage your patients to ask themselves, “What’s going through my mind right now?” |\n| Evaluating and responding to automatic thoughts | At virtually every session, you will help patients modify their inaccurate and dysfunctional thoughts and write down their new way of thinking. Patients will also learn to evaluate their own thinking and practice doing so between sessions. |\n| Problem-solving | At virtually every session, you will help patients devise solutions to their problems, which they will implement between sessions. |\n| Behavioural skills | To effectively solve their problems, patients may need to learn new skills, which they will practice for homework. |\n| Behavioural experiments | Patients may need to directly test the validity of automatic thoughts that seem distorted, such as “I’ll feel better if I stay in bed” |\n| Bibliotherapy | Important concepts you are discussing in session can be greatly reinforced when patients read about them in black and white. |\n| Preparing for the next session | Preparing for the next therapy session. The beginning part of each therapy session can be greatly speeded up if patients think about what is important to tell you before they enter your office. |\n\nYou should also decide the frequency of the homework should be assigned: should it be daily, weekly?\n\nIf your patient does not do homework, that’s OK! Explore as a team, in a non-judgmental way, to explore why the homework was not done. Here are some ways to increase adherence to homework:\n\n1.  Covert rehearsal - running through a thought experiment on a situation\n    \n2.  Change the assignment - It is far better to substitute an easier homework assignment that patients are likely to do than to have them establish a habit of not doing what they had agreed to in session\n    \n3.  Intellectual/emotional role play - “I’ll be the intellectual part of you; you be the emotional part. You argue as hard as you can against me so I can see all the arguments you’re using not to read your coping cards and start studying. You start.”"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity","markdown":"**Consent and Capacity** are two central tenets in modern medicine and critical to patient autonomy, the respect for personal dignity, and the delivery of ethical care by physicians. This page focuses specifically on [legislation and laws in the province of Ontario, Canada](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/home \"teaching:on:mha:home\"). The basic principles can be applied throughout Canada, because of the 2003 Supreme Court ruling ([Starson v. Swayze](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2064/index.do \"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2064/index.do\")) but please be aware of your own jurisdiction's specifics.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\nObtaining **Informed Consent** is the process of getting permission from a patient before conducting a healthcare intervention (e.g. - prescribing a medication or a surgical procedure). Only a health practitioner (i.e. - usually the most responsible provider, or MRP) who has the knowledge to answer a person’s questions about the treatment can carry out the process of obtaining informed consent to the treatment. For a patient to provide consent to a treatment, they must be capable (i.e. - able to “understand” and “appreciate” the nature of a treatment - see [Capacity](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity#capacity \"teaching:on:consent-capacity\") section below). There is no specific age requirement to consent (but obviously one must factor that a 4-year-old will not have the same understanding of any treatment compared to a 40-year-old).\n\nWhen a physician obtains informed consent, it must:\n\n1.  **Be related to a treatment** or treatment plan\n    \n2.  **Be informed** (the nature of treatment, risks, side effects, expected benefits, alternatives, likely consequences of refusing are discussed)\n    \n3.  **Be voluntary** (not under coercion, or under duress)\n    \n4.  **Not be obtained through fraud or misrepresentation** (by the physician)\n    \n\n#### Consent is Also Required Before You Disclose Patient Information![](#consent-is-also-required-before-you-disclose-patient-information)\n\nSeparate from treatment consent, communication/disclosure consent must also be obtained from patients prior to divulging personal health information to the patient's family or friends.\n\nThe key components of obtaining informed consent from your patient includes discussing the following:\n\n1.  **Nature** of the treatment\n    \n2.  **Expected benefits** of the treatment\n    \n3.  **Material risks** of the treatment\n    \n4.  **Material side effects** of the treatment\n    \n5.  **Alternative courses of action** (i.e - alternate treatments including non-pharmacological)\n    \n6.  **Likely consequences of _not_ having the treatment**\n    \n7.  **Likely consequences of _having_ the treatment**\n    \n\n#### What Are 'Material' Risks and Side Effects?[](#what-are-material-risks-and-side-effects)\n\nMaterial risks or side effects of treatment include:\n\n*   Those which are probable or likely to occur\n    \n*   Those which are possible if they carry serious consequences\n    \n*   Those which a reasonable person in the patient’s specific circumstances would want to know in order to make a decision to give or refuse consent\n    \n\n#### Sample Documentation for Informed Consent for a Medication Class[](#sample-documentation-for-informed-consent-for-a-medication-class)\n\n| Class | Documentation |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Antipsychotics** | Consent was obtained to start the antipsychotic. The benefits of treatment were discussed, including reduction of psychotic symptoms, improved insight, judgment, and reduction in maladaptive behaviours. We also discussed the likely possibility of worsening symptoms and the clinical course without treatment. The rare risk of death/CVA, NMS, parkinsonism, involuntary movements due to EPS were also discussed. We discussed possible side effects including falls, sedation, metabolic syndrome, and QTc prolongation/arrhythmia. We also discussed the importance of ongoing monitoring for metabolic syndrome and side effects such as hyperlipidemia, and elevated glucose. |\n| **Antidepressants** | Consent was obtained to start an antidepressant for the patient. We discussed the common side effects, including nausea, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and increased anxiety, and that most of these side effects will self-resolve 1 to 2 weeks into treatment. Rare but serious side effects, including serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, elevated bleeding risk, anti-depressant-induced mania/hypomania, and increased risk of suicidal ideation were also discussed. |\n\n#### Sample Documentation for Informed Consent for a Specific Medication[](#sample-documentation-for-informed-consent-for-a-specific-medicat)\n\n| Medication | Documentation |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Clozapine**[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) | Consent was obtained to start clozapine for the patient. We discussed the risks and benefits of treatment with clozapine, including side effects such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis, weight gain, hypersalivation, as well as metabolic side effects. We also discussed the benefits of treatment, including reduction in symptoms of psychosis. We also discussed the role of ongoing blood work and monitoring involved. |\n\nAn individual can be treated in an emergency without their consent if they are experiencing severe suffering, _or_ are at risk of sustaining serious bodily harm to themselves or others if the treatment is not given promptly. Similarly, emergency treatment can proceed if the delay required to obtain consent, _or_ their refusal would prolong their suffering, _or_ put themselves at risk of sustaining serious bodily harm. This allows physicians to give medications to manage acute agitation in patients.\n\n#### Voluntary Patients and Physical Restraints[](#voluntary-patients-and-physical-restraints)\n\nThe key point is that there is a difference between physical restraint/confinement, versus treatment. Physical restraint is not a medical treatment, and therefore consent not is required. **However**, the Mental Health Act also states there can be **NO RESTRAINTS** for voluntary or informal patients. In an emergency setting, a voluntary or informal patient _can_ be restrained, but one must immediately reassess the patient's legal status (i.e. - do they now meet criteria for a Form 1), because you **CANNOT** hold a voluntary patient in seclusion/restraints beyond the immediate emergency situation. However, the bottom line is always safety first!\n\n**Capacity** is the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of a treatment. The approach to capacity (especially for psychiatric reasons) has become more nuanced in the last few decades. Capacity is no longer a one-time assessment that applies globally to everything. Instead, capacity can fluctuate, and also is specific to the type of treatment being offered.\n\nThese are the key points to consider regarding capacity:\n\n1.  **An individual is capable until proven otherwise**\n    \n2.  **Capacity can fluctuate** (i.e. - someone may be capable at one time regarding a treatment and incapable at another)[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n    \n3.  **Capacity is task-specific** (i.e. - capacity for finances is different than capacity for admission to a long-term care facility)\n    \n4.  **Capacity is treatment-specific** (i.e. - antipsychotics vs. mood stabilizers, diabetes management vs. chemotherapy for cancer, neurosurgery for brain cancer vs. acetaminophen for a headache)\n    \n5.  **Capacity is functional**  (i.e. - just because someone is diagnosed with a mental disorder does not mean they are incapable)\n    \n6.  **Disagreement or refusal with medical recommendations does not equate to incapacity**\n    \n7.  **Acquiescing to treatment does not prove capacity**\n    \n8.  The **best interests of the person are not relevant** to the question of determining capacity\n    \n\n#### Capacity in Children[](#capacity-in-children)\n\nAlthough controversial, it is generally assumed that an individual < 6 years of age not capable, age 6-13 can have partial capacity, and over age 13 can be capable but with variability.\n\n#### Supreme Court of Canada 2003 Ruling[](#supreme-court-of-canada-2003-ruling)\n\n_While a patient need not agree with a particular diagnosis, if it is demonstrated that he has a mental “condition”, the patient must be able to acknowledge the possibility that he is affected by that condition…As a result, a patient is not required to describe his mental condition as an “illness”, or to otherwise characterize the condition in negative terms…_ **Nonetheless, if the patient’s condition results in him being unable to recognize that he is affected by its manifestations**, _he will be unable to apply the relevant information to his circumstances, and_ **unable to appreciate the consequences of his decision**.\n\n– Justice John C. Major, Starson v. Swayze, [2003 Supreme Court of Canada 32, \\[2003\\] 1 S.C.R. 722](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc33/2003scc33.html \"https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc33/2003scc33.html\")\n\nA **Capacity Assessment** involves assessing two branches: (1) the patient's ability to **understand** the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, and (2) the patient's ability to **appreciate** the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or _lack_ of a decision. Incapacity occurs when, _on a balance of probabilities_, the patient fails either one or both branches of the capacity test. Furthermore, this must be documented appropriately in the patient's chart.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\nWhen doing a capacity assessment for treatment with medication, you should to discuss treatment options in terms of classes of medications (i.e. - antipsychotics, antidepressants, etc.) This gives you broader coverage to change antipsychotics without needing to do repeat capacity assessments. You cannot obtain capacity/consent beyond a class of medications (i.e. - you cannot do a capacity assessment or obtain consent for all forms of psychiatric medications!). If you deem a patient incapable, you have to ask yourself: the patient is _incapable to what specific treatment_? There is no such thing as “global incapacity.”\n\n#### The Two Branches of Capacity[](#the-two-branches-of-capacity)\n\n|     | Understanding | Appreciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Description | Is the person is able to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment? Do they have the cognitive ability to attend to, comprehend, retain and process relevant information? | Are they able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or _lack_ of decision. An individual fails this test if they are unable to recognize the possibility that they are affected by the manifestations of the condition you describe to them and cannot appreciate the consequences of the decision being made. |\n| Factors | • What information has been given to the patient?  <br>• What is the patient's response to this information? | • Discuss what you think are the reasonably forseeable consequences from treatment, or lack of treatment.  <br>• Are they able to apply the relevant information to their own circumstances and to weigh foreseeable risks and benefits? |\n| Examples of failing this branch | • Individuals with a cognitive condition (e.g. - dementia, traumatic brain injury) that impedes their ability to retain and or process the information.  <br>• There is a very high threshold to actually fail this branch of the test (and most patients will pass it) | • A patient diagnosed with schizophrenia is able to understand the information about the illness, and that it can affect some people, but does not believe that he/she has that illness, in spite of a two-year history of symptoms consistent with schizophrenia, hospitalization and treatment.  <br>• A patient diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is able to understand and intelligently discuss the nature and consequences of the illness and readily acknowledges that people have to eat or that they may die. In spite of this, the patient is not able to eat and maintains that he/she will be fine. |\n\n##### Documentation[](#documentation)\n\nA finding of incapacity need to be documented on the medical record. In Ontario, if incapacity is for psychiatric reasons, a notice to the patient (Form 33) must be given, and rights advice must be notified. For non-psychiatric purposes, one does not need to give a Form 33 to the patient nor notify a rights adviser. However, the physician should provide rights information to the patient. After a finding of incapacity, you should continually assess capacity and document this; this is considered good practice!\n\n#### Sample Documentation for Capacity Assessment[](#sample-documentation-for-capacity-assessment)\n\nA capacity assessment was done today. \\[Patient\\] agreed/disagreed with a provisional diagnosis of \\[mental disorder\\]. \\[Patient\\] agreed/disagreed that they had a mental disorder. \\[Patient\\] was able/unable to understand the side effects of treatment with an antipsychotic such as paliperidone. When asked how these medications relates to the diagnosis of psychosis/schizophrenia, \\[Patient\\] could not apply it to their own situation. Furthermore, when asked in detail about what would happen if they were to stop taking medications, they said \\[patient quote\\].\n\n\\[Patient\\] was unable to appreciate the foreseeable consequences of taking antipsychotics or lack of taking antipsychotic medications. \\[Patient\\] COULD NOT apply the relevant information provided to them to their own circumstances or weigh foreseeable risks and benefits. In particular, they could not appreciate that their non-adherence to medication would likely lead to \\[symptoms of disorder\\]. Based on this assessment, \\[Patient\\] fails the SECOND BRANCH of the capacity test.\n\nIn Ontario, psychiatric and medical incapacity are separate. See the table below for an example.\n\n#### Incapacity for Mental Health vs. Medical Treatment[](#incapacity-for-mental-health-vs-medical-treatment)\n\n|     | Incapacity for Mental Health Treatment | Incapacity for Medical Treatment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Example Diagnosis | Schizophrenia | Diabetic Ketoacidosis |\n| Cause of Incapacity | Delusions and hallucinations leading to inability to appreciate that treatment is needed | Delirium and decreased level of consciousness leading to inability to understand and appreciate that treatment is needed |\n| Proposed Treatment | Antipsychotics | Insulin |\n| [Mental Health Act (MHA)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/home \"teaching:on:mha:home\") Applies? | Yes | No  |\n| [Health Care Consent Act (HCCA)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/hcca \"teaching:on:hcca\") Applies? | Yes | Yes |\n| [Form 33](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-33 \"teaching:on:mha:form-33\") | Required | Not required (Rights Advisor does not need to be not notified. Rights Advice only needs to be provided by the health practitioner) |\n| Leaving Against Medical Advice | Can leave if status is a voluntary patient. Otherwise, cannot leave if on a Form 1, Form 3, or Form 4. | Can leave if status is a voluntary patient. If there is a legitimate safety concern about the patient leaving, you would thus need to issue a Form 1 (e.g. - trying to leave during an episode of delirium) |\n\n#### Grey Areas[](#grey-areas)\n\nThere may be situations where a patient may have both medical and psychiatric issues (e.g. delirium + schizophrenia, substance intoxication + schizophrenia, diabetic ketoacidosis + schizophrenia), and it is unclear which underlying issue is causing the incapacity. In this case, you will want to carefully document your reasoning (e.g. - why you think it is primarily psychiatric or primarily medical).\n\nIn Ontario, if a patient is found incapable, you must find a **Substitute Decision Maker** (SDM) to give consent on the patient's behalf. The hierarchy of SDMs is dictated by the [Healthcare Consent Act (HCCA)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/hcca \"teaching:on:hcca\"). Here are some points to consider when an SDM is involved:\n\n##### Consent and Capacity Board Hearings[](#consent-and-capacity-board-hearings)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology/1-approach-neuro-emergencies","markdown":"**Neurologic Emergencies** must be managed efficiently and quickly, and several common presentations occur in the emergency setting. Common neurological emergencies include stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), altered level of consciousness, subarachnoid bleeding, seizures, and cauda equina syndrome. An approach to each emergency is briefly described below.\n\n## Stroke and TIAs[](#stroke-and-tias)\n\nA **Stroke** is any vascular injury that reduces cerebral blood flow to a specific region of the brain. A **TIA** (transient ischemic attack) is a brief episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by a focal disturbance of brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour, and without evidence of infarction.\n\n### Anatomy and Localization[](#anatomy-and-localization)\n\nCirculation of the brain is provided through anterior and posterior circulation:\n\n1.  **Anterior circulation** via the internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries (ACA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) perfuses 80% of brain. This includes the optic nerve, retina, fronto-parietal and anterior-temporal lobes, and more\n    \n2.  **Posterior circulation** via the vertebral arteries, basilar artery, posterior cerebral artery, and posterior communicating artery perfuses the other 20% of the brain. This supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, visual occipital cortex, and more\n    \n\n#### Stroke Localization[](#stroke-localization)\n\n| Stroke location | Symptoms |\n| --- | --- |\n| ACA (anterior cerebral artery) | • Primarily frontal lobe function  <br>• Paralysis/hypesthesia of lower limb on contralateral side  <br>• Lower limb weakness > upper limb  <br>• Impaired judgement/insight |\n| MCA (middle cerebral artery) | • Marked motor/sensory findings (upper limb > lower limb) on contralateral side  <br>• Ipsilateral hemianopsia  <br>• Agnosia common  <br>• Aphasia common if dominant hemisphere affected |\n| Posterior Circulation Stroke (vertebrobasilar) | • Widest variety of symptoms, difficult to diagnose  <br>• Cranial nerves, cerebellum, neurosensory tract involvement  <br>• Vision and thought processing may be involved (occipital and parietal lobes)  <br>• May have “crossed deficits” - bilateral findings |\n\nIn acute ischemic stroke, hypertension should be managed and monitored. If using thrombolysis, one should treat to blood pressure < 185/110. If not a candidate for thromblysis, only treat if BP > 220/120, and aim for 10-20% reduction. Anti-hypertensives like nitrendipine, labetalol, nitroprusside can be used.\n\n**Altered level of consciousness** can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies. Think about the context of the symptoms: the elderly are more susceptible to infectious etiologies, medication changes, stroke, occult trauma (e.g. - chronic SDH), young adults/adolescents are more susceptible to recreational drug use and trauma, and children are more susceptible to accidental toxic ingestions. Hypoactive delirium should be a diagnosis of exclusion and it is important to rule out any acute medical causes. Always check if the patient is protecting their airway (a VBG can be useful - if there is worsening hypercarbia, this requires an ICU consult!)\n\n#### Altered LOC Etiologies[](#altered-loc-etiologies)\n\n|     | Differential |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metabolic/systemic derangements | **[Delirium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/1-delirium \"cl:1-delirium\")**, hypoxia, DKA, hypoglycemia, hypoperfusion, infection, toxic drug effects, post-ictal states, [electrolyte disturbance](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/on-call/approach-to-im-on-call-emergencies-issues#electrolyte-abnormalities \"on-call:approach-to-im-on-call-emergencies-issues\"), [glucose disturbance](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/on-call/approach-to-im-on-call-emergencies-issues#glucose-abnormalities \"on-call:approach-to-im-on-call-emergencies-issues\") |\n| Structural lesions | Head trauma (SDH, EDH, SAH, concussion), stroke (thrombotic, embolic, hemorrhagic), tumour (mass effect, edema, bleeds), infection (meningitis, abscess, mass) |\n\nThe most common cause of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) is trauma, and in non-traumatic cases, about 80% is due to aneurysms. SAH can present in one of three ways:\n\n1.  Decreased LOC or Headache/focal signs\n    \n2.  Classic presentation (sudden/abrupt, intense severity 10/10 pain, _unique_ quality not like typical headache they have had, associated symptoms of nausea/vomiting, syncope, seizures, diplopia\n    \n3.  Atypical presentation\n    \n\n**Seizures** are sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain. The presentation can vary from uncontrolled jerking movement (tonic-clonic seizures) to something as subtle as a momentary loss of awareness (absence seizure).\n\nIf you witness a seizure, call for help, as the patient will likely have decreased LOC following the event. It is appropriate to call a code blue (“Medical Emergency”) if you need medications or more support. The first line treatment is with benzodiazepines either IV (preferred, or if not available then IM). Give lorazepam 2mg, or midazolam 2mg, or diazepam 5mg q2-5minutes PRN until seizures are controlled. If not already on antiepileptics, it is reasonable to load them with dilantin (20mg/kg) to prevent further seizures.\n\n**Cauda Equina Syndrome** is a neurological syndrome caused by compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina. The most common cause is due to massive midline disk herniation. There is a classic triad of:\n\n1.  Saddle anesthesia\n    \n2.  Loss of bowel/bladder function (overflow incontinence)\n    \n3.  Lower extremity weakness (at multiple spinal levels)."}

The overall goal of CTOs is to prevent mental health deterioration due to medication non-compliance. This is especially applicable in patients with a history of deteriorating when off medication, and show improvement when they are back on medications.\n\nIn Ontario, an active CTO allows a patient to be recalled back to hospital for assessment (through issuing a Form 47). A CTO expires every 6 months, but can be renewed. Each year, there is also a [Consent and Capacity Board (CCB)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity-board-hearings \"teaching:on:consent-capacity-board-hearings\") hearing to justify whether a CTO needs to remain in place (to ensure that personal liberties are not infringed).

The patient is brought to a healthcare facility by law enforcement. This does not need to be a hospital emergency room - it can be a clinic, or any other area where a physician works. The patient is then seen for examination and the treatment is then given to the patient. The physician who _receives_ the Form 47 when the patient is brought into hospital can give the treatment, it does not have to be the same physician who issued the Form 47.\n\n#### Good Practices for Issuing a Form 47[](#good-practices-for-issuing-a-form-47)\n\n*   You must specify the hospital/location where you want the patient should be brought (e.g. - the patient has health records there and you want them to go there)\n    \n*   When issuing a Form 47, attach the Form 45 (CTO) and Community Treatment Plan. This is important, because the Form 45 dictates the treatment plan, and the physician receiving the Form 47 needs to know what treatment is.\n    \n\n### Common Myths and Errors[](#common-myths-and-errors)\n\nThere are several common errors that physicians may make when assessing a patient brought in on a Form 47. Most commonly a patient brought into hospital on a Form 47 are seen in the emergency department.\n\n#### Form 47 Myths and Common Errors[](#form-47-myths-and-common-errors)\n\n| MD Myth/Error | Explanation |\n| --- | --- |\n| “A patient on a CTO is always incapable.” | Almost true. Most patients on a CTO are deemed incapable to consent. However, there are patients who are _capable_ who also consent to a CTO as a “safety net.” |\n| “I deem them to be not certifiable at this time.” | A patient on a CTO is by definition, certifiable under Box B criteria of the Mental Health Act. Your one-time assessment of the patient at this time does not overturn the certifiability. |\n| “I deem this patient to be capable at this time, and cannot give the CTO treatment” | If the patient was previously found incapable, you cannot overturn a finding of incapacity based on your one-time assessment of the patient when they are brought in on the Form 47. If a patient was incapable when the CTO was issued (as typically is the case), they continue to be assumed incapable to consent to the treatment outlined in the CTO right now as well. |\n| “I have not been able to reach the SDM, therefore I cannot give the CTO treatment.“ | You still need to give the treatment, because there is already a treatment plan in existence as documented in the CTO. You do not need to contact the SDM as they have already given permission. |\n| “I cannot give this person the treatment, because they are refusing it.” | The patient cannot refuse treatment because a treatment plan has already been outlined in the CTO. You are legally able to enforce treatment. |\n\n**A patient does not need to be incapable to be on a CTO**, although the majority of patients are. Therefore, although 99% of the time, patients on a CTO are already deemed incapable, you must keep in mind there are also capable patients on CTOs. An example would be a patient with bipolar I, and episodes of mania where they decompensate rapidly. Patients like these may request the use of a CTO as as “safety net” to enforce treatment on them during a manic episode.\n\n#### CTO for a Capable Patient vs. Incapable Patient[](#cto-for-a-capable-patient-vs-incapable-patient)\n\n| Incapable patient | Capable patient |\n| --- | --- |\n| Can be brought in under a Form 47 and be obliged to accept treatment from previously dictated 6-month treatment plan (Form 45) | Can be brought in on a Form 47, and be assessed for capacity and treatment, but ultimately, the patient can cancel the CTO if they want, provided they are still capable. If consent for CTO is withdrawn at any point, (even when they are well, or if the patient says: “by the way cancel that CTO” in a random phone call) you have a 72-hour period to re-assess the patient. You can actually re-issue a Form 47 to compel a patient to come to hospital for that assessment. |\n\n##### Legal[](#legal)"}

Give ASA 160mg, clopidogrel 300-600mg or ticagrelor 180mg loading dose, and unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (consider bleeding risk, can choose fondaparinux). Pain can be managed with morphine. Oxygen should also be given. | Less likely to be MI if the pain is reproduced on palpation |\n| NSTEMI | Can use the same medications as above for STEMI | Less likely to be MI if the pain is reproduced on palpation |\n| Pulmonary Embolism (PE) | PEs are notoriously difficult to detect, but you must be aware of when it could happen! CTPE can be ordered (The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is negligible if the patient does not have an AKI or CKD (roughly as long as Cr < 100 you are OK), else you have to think twice about it). Anticoagulation is the first-line treatment (see side-bar for more details). | If the pain is pleuritic with respiration, consider a pulmonary embolism. Any new or worsening tachycardia plus hypoxia with no ECG changes should make you suspect a possible PE. In conjunction with a normal CXR, this would be enough to treat empirically with anticoagulation |\n| GERD | Should be a diagnosis of exclusion in new-onset chest pain. Treat with Almagel (magnesium hydroxide) or ranitidine |     |\n\n#### PE Patients Can Become Rapidly Unable[](#pe-patients-can-become-rapidly-unable)\n\nAny sign of hemodynamic instability should prompt involvement of a rapid response team. These patients can be quite tenuous and deteriorate quickly\n\n#### PEs, Anticoagulation, and CTPEs[](#pes-anticoagulation-and-ctpes)\n\nHere are some clinical pearls to think about in the management of PEs:\n\n*   Anticoagulation does not necessarily need to be started right away, even if you order a CTPE. However, in a severely ill patient with significant symptoms or hemodynamic changes, (such as tachycardia, hypoxia, and normal CXR), then you should more urgently\n    \n*   Subsegmental PEs are controversial and may not account for your patient’s pain\n    \n\n#### Anticoagulation[](#anticoagulation)\n\nHere are some tips for dosing depending on the type of heparin you choose:\n\n*   Unfractionated heparin\n    \n    *   The nomogram seems confusing but in essence: more heparin makes blood thinner, and less heparin makes it less thin. The nomogram provides dose guidance for this. Look for the patient’s weight on the left, and choose a loading dose based on weight if you want them anticoagulated faster. Check the PTT q6h and adjust increase or decrease the infusion rate. Generally, you want a high dose nomogram for treatment and a low dose nomogram if you are concerned about bleeding risk\n        \n*   Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)\n    \n    *   Enoxaparin 1mg/kg SC will last for 12h\n        \n    *   Tinzaparin 175u/kg SC rounded to nearest cartridge dose\n        \n\n [![The ECG In Acute MI, Stephen W.

Thus psychiatrists must play some role in assessing or diagnosing both psychiatric, [neurological](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/neurology \"neurology\"), _and_ medical causes of psychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, for many psychiatrists, the physical exam and investigations has often been deferred to other specialists or family doctors. Thus, rather than sharpening the physical exam and general medical knowledge for psychiatric practice, it has become lost in routine practice for many. What may end up happening is the psychiatrist requesting for “**medical clearance**” of a patient, which is actually a clinically useless term that is poorly defined.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\n_“Now that I have full-blown, raging, impossible-to-miss Parkinson's disease, I really resent all those preceding years with the “depression” diagnosis: all those fleeting episodes of loss of balance, the tripping, falling, stumbling, spilling, dropping things; all those psychotropic drugs that never made a single bit of difference in my “mood disorder.” Dopamine is always prominently listed alongside serotonin as a brain chemical, and yet they bombarded my brain with increasingly toxic psychiatric concoctions. Never mind that I had long before lost my sense of smell. Never mind that I described “shaking inside” before the tremors were visible on the outside. Nowadays, I take a hit of dopamine and the relief is indescribable. Not only does the tremoring stop for a little while, but the onset of momentary happiness … I think it's happiness.

The reality is that it is impossible to rule out all medical conditions that _could_ mimic psychiatric illness within the course of a single visit, especially in an emergency setting, and there are increasingly medical conditions that bridge the gap between both medical and psychiatric domains (e.g. - [autoimmune encephalitis](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/cl/0-autoimmune-encephalitis/home \"cl:0-autoimmune-encephalitis:home\")). Thus, the term “medically clear” is inaccurate and misleading.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/agitation","markdown":"**Acute agitation** (a “Code White”) in the medical setting can present as a challenge for both patients and health care providers. When using medications to manage acute agitation, there are several key concepts to consider, including the route of administration, onset of action, absorption, half-life, and the risk of adverse events.\n\n##### What to Give?[](#what-to-give)\n\nCurrent practices for acutely agitated patients includes the combined use of an antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine. The reason for this combination is because it results in a rapid onset of action, with a short total duration of action and high sedation. Certain types of antipsychotics are also chosen to lower the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Anticholinergics may be given in combination as well to reduce the risk of [extrapyramidal symptoms](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\").\n\n#### Don't Forget About Verbal De-escalation![](#dont-forget-about-verbal-de-escalation)\n\nBefore doing any kind of pharmacological intervention for agitation, always think about non-pharmacological ways to de-escalate the situation. In any Code White situation, understand that a patient is usually feeling threatened or scared, often due to their psychiatric symptoms or the stressful environment that they are in. In these cases, it is helpful to consider triggers that may be leading to these behaviours. For example, is there some way to bring the patient to a calmer environment and avoid the need for medications?\n\nIf security or additional staff are called to a Code White, it is important to outline to an agitated patient why there are additional people. If the patient doesn't understand why so many people are near them, this may worsen agitation or cause fear! Reassure the patient. For example, it can be helpful to tell the patient: “You may be wondering why there are security guards here.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4","markdown":"A **Form 4** (_Medical Certificate for Involuntary Admission_), is a form under the [British Columbia Mental Health Act](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/home \"teaching:bc:mha:home\") that allows a person to be apprehended, transported, admitted, treated, and detained as an involuntary patient for up to 48 hours. A second Form 4 (Form 4.2) can be completed to extend the involuntary hospitalization for up to 1 calendar month starting from the date of involuntary admission. Nurse practitioners are now able to issue a Form 4.1 (i.e. - the 1st Form 4), as of February 1, 2023 in British Columbia. A Form 4.2 continues to require an assessment and sign-off by a physician.\n\n#### Download Form 4[](#download-form-4)\n\nPatients need not always be admitted involuntarily for psychiatric disorders. If a patient is willingly coming into the hospital, they can be admitted in one of two ways:\n\n1.  Under British Columbia's Hospital Act, which does not require the use of mental health forms. In routine clinical practice, this is the most common way of admitting voluntary patients as there is no paperwork required.\n    \n2.  Or, a patient could also be admitted voluntarily under British Columbia's Mental Health Act, but this would require giving the patient a [Form 1](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-1 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-1\") (Request for Admission) and [Form 2](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-2 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-2\") (Consent for Treatment) In routine clinical practice, this is rarely done except for individuals under age 16.\n    \n\nPolice officers have powers under Section 28 of the MHA to take an individual into custody and to transport them to a designated facility for assessment by a physician who will determine the need for further treatment. The criteria used by the police are:\n\n1.  If the person is acting in a manner likely to endanger that person's own safety or the safety of others; and\n    \n2.  If the person is apparently a person with a mental disorder.\n    \n\nUpon arrival, police must keep the person in their custody until the individual is examined by a physician.\n\nIn order for an individual to be admitted involuntarily, **all** of the following four criteria must be met; a physician must be of the opinion that an individual:\n\n1.  Is suffering from an apparent mental disorder that seriously impairs their ability to react appropriately to his or her environment or to associate with others;\n    \n2.  Requires psychiatric treatment in or through a designated facility\n    \n3.  Requires care, supervision, and control in (or through) a designated facility to prevent the person's substantial mental or physical deterioration, or for the person's own protection, or for the protection of others; _and_\n    \n4.  Is not suitable as a voluntary patient\n    \n\nIf all of the above criteria is met, a Form 4 must be completed by a physician licensed to practice medicine in British Columbia. The physician does not need to be a psychiatrist. A resident physician (i.e. - educational license) is not legally allowed to complete a Form 4.\n\n#### What does 'Protection' Mean?[](#what-does-protection-mean)\n\nProtection as defined by BC law includes not just physical protection, but also social, family, work, or financial life of the patient.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\n#### Old Form 4[](#old-form-4)\n\nThe old Form 4 will continue to be legally valid for physicians to complete until February 1, 2024, after which point Form 4.1 and Form 4.2 must be used.\n\n#### How Long Does the Second Form 4 Last?[](#how-long-does-the-second-form-4-last)\n\n*   All together, two completed medical certificates (i.e. - two Form 4s) are good for one month from the date of involuntary admission\n    \n*   A calendar month is considered 1 month minus 1 day under BC law. Thus, if an individual received the first Form 4 (initial certification) on May 23 and then received a second Form 4, this means their entire admission could last until midnight on June 22 (i.e. - on June 22 at 11:59pm). The moment the clock hits midnight, and it becomes June 23, 2013, the patient can no longer be involuntarily admitted (unless a [Form 6](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-6 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-6\") is issued beforehand).\n    \n\n_“Irrespective of the duration of the involuntary admission, [Forms 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-4\"), [5](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-5 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-5\"), [13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\"), [15](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-15 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-15\") and [16](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-16 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-16\") must be completed.”_\n\n– Office of Ombudsperson Province of British Columbia Report: Committed to Change: Protecting the Rights of Involuntary Patients under the Mental Health Act[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\nThe following Forms **must** be completed immediately on admission, regardless of the length of a patient's involuntary admission:\n\n#### 'Date of Involuntary Admission' Example[](#date-of-involuntary-admission-example)\n\n*   Jane Doe brought herself to hospital on **January 5th** with persecutory delusions. She came to the hospital seeking help, and was thus admitted voluntarily.\n    \n*   One week later, on **January 12th**, she started to become paranoid about staff on the unit and requested to be discharged from hospital.\n    \n    *   She was assessed by two psychiatrists in hospital and two [Form 4s](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-4\") (i.e. - Medical Certificate for Involuntary Admission), were completed on **January 12th** (the same day).\n        \n*   It is now **February 1st** and she is approaching the 1-month period of being in hospital but she has not improved and continues to meet all 4 criteria for certification.\n    \n\n*   Since the date of renewal is based on the **date of involuntary admission** to hospital it is important to remember she did not become involuntary until **January 12th**. The first week of admission was voluntary, so she has been certified and involuntarily admitted only since **January 12th**.\n    \n    *   This means her second Form 4 will last until February 11th 11:59pm, and expires on February 12th (the moment the clock strikes at midnight!)\n        \n    *   Practically speaking, you must then complete the Form 6 at some point on February 11th at the latest.\n        \n\n#### Example[](#example)\n\n| Action | Form to Fill | Length of Involuntary Admission | Form to Give to Patient | Begins | Expires |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Involuntary Hospitalization Date | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  | March 15, 2020 (AKA - involuntary hospitalization date) | \\-  |\n| 1st Medical Certificate | [Form 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-4\") | 48 hours | [Form 13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\") | March 15, 2020 | 48 hours after March 15, 2020 |\n| 2nd Medical Certificate | [Form 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-4\") | 1 month from involuntary hospitalization date (minus 1 day) | [Form 13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\") | March 15, 2020 | April 14, 2020 @11:59pm |\n| 1st Renewal | [Form 6](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-6 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-6\") | 1 month (minus 1 day) | [Form 13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\") | April 15, 2020 | May 14, 2020 @11:59pm |\n| 2nd Renewal | [Form 6](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-6 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-6\") | 3 months (minus 1 day) | [Form 13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\") | May 15, 2020 | August 14, 2020 @11:59pm |\n| 3rd Renewal and Additional Renewals | [Form 6](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-6 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-6\") | 6 months (minus 1 day) | [Form 13](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-13 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-13\") | August 15, 2020 | Feb 14, 2021 @11:59pm |\n\n#### When There Is No Corresponding Renewal Date[](#when-there-is-no-corresponding-renewal-date)\n\n*   When there is no corresponding date in the month the certificate/renewal ends, the _Interpretation Act_ in BC directs that the last day of that month be used.\n    \n*   For example, if two Form 4s are completed for an involuntary admission beginning on January 31, 2021, there is no February 31st, 2021!\n    \n    *   In these cases, the last day of the following month will be used\n        \n    *   Thus, the 1 month period of hospitalization will end at midnight on February 28, 2021 (or 29 in a leap year), following the “last day of the month” rule.\n        \n*   If the patient continues to require involuntary hospitalization, the subsequent first renewal (Form 6) will begin on March 1, 2021, and will end on on March 31, 2021 (i.e. - one month less a day)\n    \n*   From that point on, all future renewals take effect from the 1st of the month in perpetuity (e.g. - second renewal (Form 6), will start April 1, 2021, and ends June 30, 2021)."}

The law also has patient protections and rights to ensure the law is applied in an appropriate manner.\n\nBritish Columbia's **Mental Health Act (MHA)** became law in 1964, and there have been several legislative updates since then. The purpose of the MHA is to guide the treatment of individuals with mental disorders who require protection and care. Protection as defined by BC law includes not just physical protection, but also social, family, work, or financial life of the patient. The MHA also dictates how treatment and care can be provided if an individual is not willing to accept it.\n\nThere are `3` methods through which a person can be involuntarily transported or admitted to a designated facility:\n\n1.  Through a physician's Medical Certificate ([Form 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/bc/mha/form-4 \"teaching:bc:mha:form-4\")), this is the most common method used to initiate involuntary interventions\n    \n2.

If a patient **accepts and consents to treatment**, the Form 5 provides the space to document the course of treatment a patient has consented, and the time and date that consent was provided. Documenting a patient’s consent to treatment is particularly important in the context of an involuntary admission, because legally, the patient has actually been deprived of their right to refuse it.\n    \n2.  Alternatively, If a patient **refuses to consent or is unable to consent**, the Form 5 requires the prescribing physician to obtain the hospital director’s authorization to proceed with the proposed treatment. Under the BC Mental Health Act, the director is ultimately responsible for ensuring the patient receives treatment appropriate to their condition. Proper documentation on the Form 5 is particularly important for patients who initially on admission may have been incapable of appreciating illness or treatment but later regain some capacity.\n    \n3.  Finally, the Form 5 is an essential part of the medical-legal record for patients exercise their right to seek a second medical opinion on the appropriateness of the treatment prescribed by the patient's physician and authorized by the director.\n    \n\n#### Who Can Consent to Which Treatments for an Involuntary Patient?[](#who-can-consent-to-which-treatments-for-an-involuntary-patient)\n\nAdapted from: Ombudsperson's Special Report No. 42, Committed to Change: Protecting the Rights of Involuntary Patients under the Mental Health Act, p 47.\n\n|     | Psychiatric Treatment | Medical Treatment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Incapable | Director under the Mental Health Act using Form 5 (Part B) | Substitute decision maker (SDM) under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act |\n| Capable | Patient using Form 5 (Part A) \\[assuming patient is involuntarily admitted, but capable\\] | Patient |\n\n### Part A and B[](#part-a-and-b)"}

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/home","markdown":"The **Ontario Mental Health Act (MHA)** applies to psychiatric care, and provides rules and a legal process for voluntary, informal, and involuntary admissions. Note that the Health Care Consent Act (HCCA) applies to all aspects of health care (both medical and psychiatric) and provides rules for obtaining informed, voluntary consent for treatment, and involvement from substitute decision makers.\n\nThe MHA's purpose is to regulate the involuntary admission and treatment of people into a psychiatric hospital. Major changes were made to the law in 2000, which introduced the role of [Community Treatment Orders](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-45-47-49-cto \"teaching:on:mha:form-45-47-49-cto\"). In broad strokes, the the Mental Health Act in Ontario allows physicians to assess ([Form 1](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-1-42 \"teaching:on:mha:form-1-42\")) and also to detain ([Form 3](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-3 \"teaching:on:mha:form-3\"), [Form 4](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-4 \"teaching:on:mha:form-4\"), [Form 4A](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-4#form-4a \"teaching:on:mha:form-4\")) patients for set periods of time. The Health Care Consent Act and Mental Health Act also allows for the involuntary treatment of patients if they are incapable ([Form 33](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/mha/form-33 \"teaching:on:mha:form-33\")).\n\nThe MHA focuses on detention of patients, and thus the MHA alone does not allow you to force treatment (there must be a finding of [incapacity](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/consent-capacity \"teaching:on:consent-capacity\") under the [Health Care Consent Act](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/on/hcca \"teaching:on:hcca\") as well). Only emergency psychiatric treatment is allowed in the event of significant morbidity or mortality. Therefore, if there is no emergency and a patient refuses treatment, you **must** respect the wishes of the patient. A patient could _theoretically_ be in a situation where they detained under the MHA, but are capable and NOT treated (e.g. - a patient with schizophrenia can be detained under the MHA due to harm to others, but still be capable to make a decision to refuse an antipsychotic)."}

This absorption process can be affected by many things but the main factor relating to absorption is the route of administration.\n\n#### Absorption: Routes of drug administration[](#absorption-routes-of-drug-administration)\n\n| Routes | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oral (PO) | Convenient | GI upset |\n| Sublingual (SL) | Avoid first-pass metabolism and gastric acid (therefore GI upset) | Few preparations |\n| Rectal (PR) | Avoid first-pass metabolism and gastric acid (therefore GI upset) | Few preparations, patient comfort |\n| Intravenous (IV) | Rapid action, immediate availability | Increased levels to cardiac tissue, risk of sepsis/embolism if not sterile |\n| Intramuscular (IM) | Rapid absorption | Pain, tissue damage risk |\n| Subcutaneous (SC) | Slower absorption | Variable absorption |\n\n#### Oral Absorption and First-Pass Metabolism[](#oral-absorption-and-first-pass-metabolism)\n\nWhen a drug is consumed orally, it goes through a process called **first-pass metabolism** in the liver. First-pass metabolism reduces the bio-availability (fraction of drug absorbed into the systemic circulation) of the drug\n\nThe drug goes from the mouth → GI tract → portal vein → liver (first-pass metabolism happens here) → systemic circulation → drug target or receptor. When medications are given intramuscularly, sublingually, or rectally, this bypasses first-pass metabolism.\n\nOnce a drug is administered and absorbed, it has to be distributed to their site of action. Some drugs go into a specific organ (e.g. - iodine into the thyroid gland). Other drugs are lipophilic and highly absorbed into fatty tissue (e.g. - most antidepressants and antipsychotics). Finally, other drugs (e.g. - lithium) are mostly distributed in body water (plasma, interstitial fluid and intracellular fluid).\n\n**Volume of Distribution (Vd)** is one way to measure and quantify this drug distribution. Volume of distribution is affected by two main factors: fat stores and body water (total and extracellular). Other factors like protein binding and passage through barriers also affect distribution.\n\n#### What is Volume of Distribution?[](#what-is-volume-of-distribution)\n\n**Volume of Distribution** is a proportion factor that gives you the relationship between the _amount of drug_ in the body (mg) to the _plasma concentration of drug_ measured in a biological fluid (mg/L).\n\n![](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/volume_of_distribution.png)  \nA larger volume of distribution means the drug is more likely to be in the tissues of the body, while a smaller volume of distribution means the drug is confined to the circulatory system.\n\n#### Interpreting Volume of Distribution[](#interpreting-volume-of-distribution)\n\n| Volume of Distribution (Vd) | Distribution of Drug | Types of Drug |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Low (< 4 )L | Mostly confined to the plasma component of blood (intravascular) | Large/charged molecules; plasma protein bound |\n| Medium (4 to 7 L) | Distributed throughout the blood (both plasma and red blood cells), and extracellular fluid (ECF) | Small hydrophilic (water-loving) molecules |\n| High (> 42 L\\*) | Distributed to all tissues in the body (including fatty tissue) | Small lipophilic (fat-loving) molecules, especially if bound to tissue protein |\n| Very high (> 5000 L) | Mostly in the tissue, and very little of it is in the blood or plasma | Highly lipophilic molecules |\n\n#### Two Main Factors That Affect Volume of Distribution (Vd)[](#two-main-factors-that-affect-volume-of-distribution-vd)\n\n|     | Population | Effect on Vd | Outcome | Clinical Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lower proportion of body fat | [Children](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacology/pediatric \"meds:pharmacology:pediatric\") | ↓ Vd | For lipophilic drugs (e.g. - antidepressants and antipsychotics), a smaller Vd results in higher plasma drug concentrations | No significant effect, possibly due to increased clearance and elimination in children and adolescents |\n| Higher proportion of body fat | [Elderly](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacology/geri \"meds:pharmacology:geri\") | ↑ Vd | For lipophilic drugs (e.g. - antidepressants and antipsychotics), a larger Vd results in more storage of the drug in fatty tissue | Lipophilic drugs can accumulate in fat, remain in the body longer, and thus have a longer half-life. With repeated dosing, drugs accumulate in fat, and may be erratically released. Thus, drugs should be prescribed in a 'start low and go slow' method |\n| Higher proportion of body water | Children | ↑ Vd | For drugs primarily distributed in body water (e.g. - lithium), a larger Vd results in lower plasma drug concentration | \\-  |\n| Lower proportion of body water | Elderly | ↓ Vd | For drugs primarily distributed in body water (e.g. - lithium), a smaller Vd results in higher plasma drug concentration | Lower doses of lithium may be effective in the elderly |\n\n#### Other Factors Affecting Distribution[](#other-factors-affecting-distribution)\n\n| Factors | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plasma Protein Binding | Plasma proteins like albumin bind drug molecules. The degree of binding varies widely among drugs. Drugs bound to plasma proteins are pharmacologically inert – only the free drug is active. Some drugs do not bind at all (e.g. - caffeine) while others are highly bound (e.g. - warfarin which is 99% bound). Some drugs can displace others from their binding sites on the plasma proteins (e.g. - phenylbutazone can displace warfarin from plasma proteins). |\n| Passage through Barriers | The two main barriers in the body are the placenta and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). For example, drugs must be highly lipid soluble in order to pass the blood-brain barrier to exert their action. This is why most psychotropic drugs (e.g. - antidepressants and antipsychotics) are highly lipid-soluble. |\n\nMetabolism is the breaking down of a drug so it can be eliminated from the body. Most psychotropic drugs undergo extensive biotransformation in the liver in two phases (Phase I and Phase II):\n\n2.  **Phase II reactions (conjugation reactions, glucuronidation, acetylation, and sulfation)**:\n    \n\nBoth phase I and phase II reactions are susceptible to inhibition or induction by other drugs. For example:\n\n#### Not All Drugs Are Metabolized![](#not-all-drugs-are-metabolized)\n\nNot all drugs are metabolized. Examples include [lithium](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/1-lithium \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:1-lithium\") and [gabapentin](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants/gabapentin \"meds:mood-stabilizers-anticonvulsants:gabapentin\").\n\n#### Oral Absorption and First-Pass Metabolism[](#oral-absorption-and-first-pass-metabolism-1)\n\nWhen a drug is consumed orally, it goes through a process called **first-pass metabolism** in the liver. First-pass metabolism reduces the bio-availability (fraction of drug absorbed into the systemic circulation) of the drug\n\nThe drug goes from the mouth → GI tract → portal vein → liver (first-pass metabolism happens here) → systemic circulation → drug target or receptor. When medications are given intramuscularly, sublingually, or rectally, this bypasses first-pass metabolism.\n\n#### What is Glucuronidation?[](#what-is-glucuronidation)\n\nConjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) is the major route for the biotransformation and elimination of carboxylic acid-containing drugs. Glucuronidation is when a glucuronic acid is added to a substrate from UDP-glucuronic acid via a UDP glucuronosyltransferase.\n\nElimination refers to the removal of a drug from the body. The kidney is the most important organ for drug elimination. Clearance refers to the efficiency of drug removal (i.e. - the theoretical volume of blood that is totally cleared of drug per unit time).\n\nThe half-life is time required to reduce the plasma concentration of a drug to one half of its initial value. A drug with a half-life of 24 hours will reach steady state in approximately 5 days; similarly, one would need to stop taking this drug for 5 days in for it to be fully “out of the system.”\n\nSteady state occurs when the rate of drug absorption into the blood equals the rate of elimination from the body. The time to reach steady state concentrations depends on the half-life of the drug. Drugs with first-order elimination kinetics require 5 half-lives to reach steady state with repeated dosing. Similarly, 5 half-lives is needed for the drug to be completely eliminated from the body once the last dose is taken (see [figure 2](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacology/home#img_fig2)).\n\n [![Steady State](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/steadystate_5_.png?w=800&tok=deccb7 \"Steady State\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/steadystate_5_.png \"meds:steadystate_5_.png\") Fig. 2: Steady state example with a 100 mg drug with a half life of 24 hours[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/steadystate_5_.png)\n\n**Pharmacodynamics** is the effect of the drug _on the body_. There are 7 main drug actions that can occur on the body:\n\n1.  **Stimulating action** through direct receptor agonism and downstream effects (e.g. - dopamine agonists for Parkinson's)\n    \n2.  **Depressing action** through direct receptor agonism and downstream effects (e.g. - inverse agonist)\n    \n3.  **Blocking/antagonizing action** where the drug binds the receptor but does not activate it (e.g. - silent antagonists)\n    \n4.  **Stabilizing action** where the drug seems to act neither as a stimulant or as a depressant (e.g. - some drugs possess receptor activity that allows them to stabilize general receptor activation, such as [buprenorphine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/opioids/buprenorphine \"meds:opioids:buprenorphine\") in opioid use disorder, or [aripiprazole](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/3-aripiprazole \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:3-aripiprazole\") in schizophrenia)\n    \n5.  **Exchanging/replacing substances** or accumulating them to form a reserve (e.g. - glycogen storage)\n    \n6.  **Direct beneficial chemical reaction** (e.g. - free radical scavenging)\n    \n7.  **Direct harmful chemical reaction** (e.g. - damage or destruction of the cells through induced toxic or lethal damage, also called cytotoxicity or irritation)\n    \n\n [![Efficacy vs. Potency](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/efficacy_vs._potency.png?w=700&tok=a51863 \"Efficacy vs. Potency\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/efficacy_vs._potency.png \"meds:efficacy_vs._potency.png\") Fig. 3: Potency vs. Efficacy[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/efficacy_vs._potency.png)\n\n**Affinity** is how avidly a drug binds its receptor or how the chemical forces that cause a substance to bind its receptor. The higher affinity that a drug (also known as a ligand) has for a receptor the “cleaner” the drug. Low affinity drugs are called “dirty” drugs because they bind to many receptor types, including those that are not the intended targets.\n\n**Potency** is a measure of the quantity of drug needed to produce a maximal effect. That is, how much of a drug do you need (e.g. - 2mg vs. 200mg?) to give to achieve a desired effect.\n\n#### Confusion Alert![](#confusion-alert)\n\nThe term [efficacy](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/teaching/1-intro-statistics-medicine#efficacy-vs-effectiveness \"teaching:1-intro-statistics-medicine\") is also used in epidemiology, but describes a completely different concept!\n\n**Efficacy** is the maximum effect that a drug can produce regardless of dose.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)"}

For example, diazepam produces the active metabolites oxazepam, desmethyldiazepam, and temazepam. These metabolites increase the duration of drug action and can have an impact in older adults and in those with extensive hepatic disease. On the other hand, midazolam produces no active metabolites.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\nAnother result of the proportional increase in body fat with aging is that highly lipophilic benzodiazepines such as diazepam are rapidly taken up by the body's fat storage sites. The serum concentrations can thus fall quickly below the minimum effective threshold with one-time dosing. On the other hand, with repeated dosing, there can be significant accumulation of the drug in fat stores. This means the drug may be released erratically and lead to fluctuating serum levels over time. Thus, diazepam is not recommended in older adults or the elderly.\n\nOlder adults should have lithium started at lower doses (eg. - 300mg). They may respond to lower blood levels (eg. - 0.4- 0.7) compared to usual targets in younger adults. Pay attention for medications that may effect lithium clearance (NSAIDS, diuretics)."}

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for most phase I reactions in the liver. Understanding the role of CYP enzymes is vital in the prescribing of psychotropic medications.\n\nMost psychotropic medications are highly lipophilic substances and thus undergo biotransformation in the liver. The liver converts lipid soluble (non-polar) drugs into one or hydrophilic (polar) metabolites, which allows the drug to be eliminated into urine or bile. The metabolism of psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs in two steps:\n\n1.  **Phase I**: oxidative reactions, catalyzed via Cytochrome enzymes\n    \n2.  **Phase II**: glucuronide conjugation, which occurs through UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT).\n    \n\n### Substrates, Inhibitors, and Inducers[](#substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers)\n\nCYP enzymes are classified into families and subfamilies according to similarities in their amino acid sequence.

Co-administration of SSRIs with medications that are substrates of CYP2D6 will increase the serum concentrations of those medications, including beta-blockers such as labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Type 1C antiarrhythmics such as encainide, flecainide, propafenone, and mexiletine are also CYP2D6 substrates. As a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, fluoxetine may produce hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes who use insulin.\n\n### CYP1A2, Smoking, and Antipsychotics[](#cyp1a2-smoking-and-antipsychotics)\n\nThe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from cigarette smoke can induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, specifically CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Both olanzapine and clozapine are primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (close to 70%). Thus smoking can induce faster metabolism, while abruptly stopping smoking can inadvertently increase antipsychotic levels. It is generally recommended that smoking patients who are on clozapine or olanzapine and decide to quit smoking have a 40% reduction in their dose by 10% per day, up to 40%. Nicotine replacement products (patches, lozenges, nasal spray, inhalers, and gum) and electronic cigarettes on the other hand, do not induce CYP1A2.\n\n### Articles[](#articles)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Subramaniam, M., Ng, C., Chong, S.

A lower proportion of body fat leads to a smaller volume of distribution, while a higher proportion of body fat leads to a larger volume of distribution. For example, most psychotropic medications (antidepressants and antipsychotics) are lipophilic. The lower proportion of body fat in middle childhood results in a smaller volume of distribution, and thus _higher_ plasma drug concentrations |\n| Distribution (Body Water) | Proportion of body water(total and extracellular) is high in infancy and decreases with age. For drugs primarily distributed in body water (e.g. - lithium), the higher proportion of body water in childhood results in a larger volume of distribution, and thus _lower_ plasma drug concentrations. |\n| Metabolism | • **Phase I**: CYP450 enzyme activity develops in the fetal period and infancy, and increases in childhood to above adult levels, and then declines after puberty to adult levels. The greater CYP450 activity during childhood results in lower plasma drug concentrations (other factors being equal and adjusting the dose for weight)  <br>• **Phase II**: Glucuronide formation reaches adult levels by age 3-4 years; thereafter the efficiency of phase II reactions does not vary with age |\n| Elimination | GFR is much lower in newborns, but reaches adult values by age 6-12 months. Children have lower absolute clearance than adults because of their smaller body size, but evidence is mixed on whether children have higher weight-adjusted clearance compared to adults.[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5) |\n\nThe central nervous system undergoes substantial developmental change during childhood, adolescence, and even in early adulthood. These developmental changes in neurotransmitter systems can cause unique therapeutic and adverse effects.\n\n#### Pharmacodynamics of Neurotransmitters Systems in Children[](#pharmacodynamics-of-neurotransmitters-systems-in-children)\n\n| Neurotransmitter System | Implications |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dopamine | Children and adolescents appear to have an increased risk of [dystonic reactions](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/eps \"meds:antipsychotics:eps\") with antipsychotics |\n| Serotonin | Prepubertal children appear to have an increased risk of activating side effects (i.e. - [paradoxical reactions](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/paradoxical-reactions \"meds:paradoxical-reactions\")) from [SSRIs](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/home \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:home\") |\n| Noradrenergic | Immaturity of the noradrenergic pathways explains in part why [tricyclic antidepressants](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/tca/home \"meds:antidepressants:tca:home\") are less effective for depression in children and adolescents than in adults |\n\nOverall, the evidence for efficacy in pediatric psychopharmacology is strongest for stimulants, intermediate for SSRIs and antipsychotics, and weak for lithium and anticonvulsants. Although evidence for short-term efficacy maybe strong for a few medications in children and adolescents, _the evidence supporting the long-term use of pharmacotherapy is sparse_.

In the case of benzodiazepines, it can result in excessive movements, agitation, talkativeness, impulsivity, irritability, and/or excitement (the opposite of a benzodiazepine's intended effect). The incidence of paradoxical reactions are rare, at less than 1%. However, the _failure_ to identify paradoxical reactions may lead to a vicious cycle of progressive titration of benzodiazepines, with worsening symptoms.\n\nRisk factors for paradoxical responses include age (pediatric or geriatric), genetic predisposition, history of significant alcohol use, and being given large benzodiazepine doses. In pediatrics, the risk of paradoxical responses to benzodiazepines are most associated with age and dose. The younger the individual, the greater the risk of having atypical reactions. Higher doses are also more likely to cause a paradoxical response.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) Other risk factors include individuals with autism, learning disabilities, and neurological disorders.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\nThe exact mechanism for paradoxical reactions remains poorly understood. It is hypothesized that paradoxical reactions may be the same phenomenon related to increased risk of suicidal ideation from antidepressant use in children.\n\nParadoxical reactions should always be a diagnosis of exclusion. Once identified, the benzodiazepine must be discontinued. Observation and conservative management is usually all that is required. Case studies have also reported the use of physostigmine, flumazenil, and haloperidol.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\n**[1)](#refnotes:1:ref1)** [Kirkpatrick, D., Smith, T., Kerfeld, M., Ramsdell, T., Sadiq, H., & Sharma, A.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/pharmacogenetics","markdown":"**Pharmacogenetics** is the study of inherited genetic differences in drug metabolic pathways which can affect individual responses to drugs, both in terms of therapeutic effect as well as adverse effects. There is increasing interest in trying to use pharmacogenetics to understand which patients will respond best to which psychotropic medications.\n\nMost commercial pharmacogenetic companies test for variations of the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and one tests for the HLA allele polymorphisms. These tests can only tell a clinician if someone may need a lower than usual dose of a medication to minimize side effects, or a higher dose if they metabolize a drug too rapidly. **It does not tell you which drug will work _best_ for a patient..** In unique cases, it may be useful to identify ultrafast CYP metabolizers, if there is a suspicious of metabolism differences.\n\n#### Hold Up![](#hold-up)\n\nPharmacogenetic testing remains in the early stages and in its infancy, be aware that many commercial entities overpromise the impact of pharmacogenetic testing, and public expectations of pharmacogenetics exceeds the actual clinical evidence. For example, it remains unclear if the genetic test itself can accurately detect the genetic variant in a real-world setting. It also remains unclear if genetic testing will change clinical management and actually improve clinical outcomes. At the end of the day, there are multiple factors that affect medication effectiveness and response, including: age, ethnicity, drug-drug interactions, and substance use. Forgetting about these factors makes pharmacogenetic testing useless and a red herring in clinical practice.\n\nThe FDA has recommended that patients who carry the CYP2C19 “poor metabolizer” phenotype not be prescribed more than 20mg citalopram without an ECG.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\nThe human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a gene complex that encodes the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in humans.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/qtc","markdown":"**QT (QTc) Prolongation** is associated with many psychotropic medications (especially [antipsychotics](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\")) and some are linked to serious ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. - Torsades de Pointes) and sudden cardiac death. The risk of QT prolongation is likely dose-related, but the overall absolute risk is low. ECG monitoring is recommended for all patients on QT-prolonging agents, especially those taking medications long-term. There are few guidelines on the monitoring of QT, but it is generally recommended when a QT-prolonging agent is started, or if there are there is a dose increase. Yearly monitoring is suggested by some guidelines.\n\n#### Why is QT prolongation bad?[](#why-is-qt-prolongation-bad)\n\nThe QT interval indicates the length of cardiac repolarization (the time for the ventricles to contract and relax). Simply put, an increase in the QT interval causes heterogeneity in electrical phasing in different ventricular structures of the heart. This can cause events like ventricular extrasystole and Torsades de Pointes, leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\nThe QT interval is an interval between the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T Wave on an electrocardiocgram (in milliseconds).\n\nSince different heart rates can affect the QT interval, the QT interval is usually reported as the QTc (QT corrected for heart rate). There are 4 types of formulae to correct the QT interval, mainly Bazett, Fredericia, Framingham, and Hodges. Each type of correction formula can give markedly different QTc values.\n\nThe Bazett correction (which is most commonly used and found in most preprogrammed ECG machines that calculate the QTc), however, it tends to:\n\nThis overcall can lead to unnecessary withholding of first-line medications. Thus manual measurement using the Fredericia or Framingham corrections, or population-based nomograms have the best rate correction. These alternative methods are recommended for patients starting new drugs or on shorter regimens.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n [![QT interval](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/ecg_intervals.png?w=400&tok=e808a4 \"QT interval\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/ecg_intervals.png \"meds:ecg_intervals.png\") Fig. 1 : QT interval[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/ecg_intervals.png)\n\nRegardless of the different corrections, the QTc remains an imprecise indicator of risk of Torsades de Pointes and cardiac mortality. Combining QTc with T-wave morphology better predicts the risk for Torsades de Pointes. Some patients whose QTc falls above the traditional upper limits can also take medications that alter cardiac repolarization without developing Torsades.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3)\n\nDifferent clinical guidance exists for the cut off scores for QTc intervals (which also depend on correction methods). Below are two guidelines to guide decision making.\n\n#### Management of QT Prolongation[](#management-of-qt-prolongation)\n\nAdapted from: Taylor, D. M., Barnes, T. R., Young, A. H. (2018).

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/1-prescribing","markdown":"**Medication prescription** is cornerstone of psychiatric practice, and indeed for many areas and specialties of medicine. Understanding principles of prescribing and being a thoughtful and careful prescriber is critically important.\n\n**Think Beyond Drugs**\n\n1.  Seek non-drug alternatives first\n    \n2.  Consider potentially treatable underlying causes of problems rather than just treating the symptoms with a drug\n    \n3.  Look for opportunities for prevention rather than focusing on treating symptoms or advanced disease\n    \n4.  Use the test of time as a diagnostic and therapeutic trial whenever possible\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\n    \n\n**A Shared Care Approach**\n\n1.  Do not hastily or uncritically succumb to patient requests for drugs, especially drugs that they have heard advertised\n    \n2.  Avoid mistakenly prescribing additional drugs for refractory problems, failing to appreciate the potential for patient nonadherence\n    \n3.  Avoid repeating prescriptions for drugs that a patient has previously tried unsuccessfully or that caused an adverse reaction\n    \n4.  Discontinue treatment with drugs that are not working or are no longer needed\n    \n5.  Work with patients’ desires to be conservative with medications\n    \n\n**Think Long-Term, not just Short-Term**\n\n1.  Think beyond short-term beneficial drug effects to consider longer-term benefits and risks\n    \n2.  Look for opportunities to improve prescribing systems, changes that can make prescribing and medication use safer\n    \n\n**Strategic Prescribing**\n\n1.  Use only a few drugs and learn to use them well\n    \n2.  Avoid frequent switching to new drugs without clear, compelling evidence-based reasons\n    \n3.  Whenever possible, start treatment with only 1 drug at a time\n    \n\n**Always Think About Adverse/Side Effects**\n\n1.  Have a high index of suspicion for adverse drug effects\n    \n2.  Educate patients about possible adverse effects to ensure that they are recognized as early as possible\n    \n3.  Be alert to clues that you may be treating or risking withdrawal symptoms\u000b\u000b\u000b\n    \n\n**Skepticism About Newly Marketed Drugs**\n\n1.  Learn about new drugs and new indications from trustworthy, unbiased sources\n    \n2.  Do not rush to use newly marketed drugs\n    \n3.  Be certain that the drug improves actual patient-centered clinical outcomes rather than just treating or masking a surrogate marker\n    \n4.  Be vigilant about indications creep\n    \n5.  Do not be seduced by elegant molecular pharmacology or drug physiology (e.g. - [vortioxetine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/serotonin-modulator/vortioxetine \"meds:antidepressants:serotonin-modulator:vortioxetine\"))\n    \n6.  Beware of selective reporting of studies\u000b\n    \n\n_“To write prescriptions is easy, but to come to an understanding with people is hard”_  \n– Franz Kafka\n\nThe following are some tips to guide prescribing in patients, especially in adolescents and the elderly (excerpted from Mark Chenven, MD, The Carlat Child Psychiatry Report):\n\n1.  **Start low, go slow:** Most side effects are dose related, so gradual up-titration is simple common sense. This allows for the body’s homeostatic and regulatory mechanisms to respond gradually and reduces the severity of emerging side effects.\n    \n2.  **One step at a time:** Making one change at a time is another sound practice as this allows for monitoring the impact of one changed variable. An exception to this rule would be a situation where you are cross titrating between two agents and/or dealing with a clinically complex problematic situation.\n    \n3.  **Consider weekend trials:** Starting a new medication or making a significant dosage adjustment over the weekend affords parents and the child or teen the opportunity to monitor for both efficacy and side effects.\n    \n4.  **Seek feedback:** Requesting parents or the older adolescent/young adult patient to call with any emerging concern and scheduling timely follow up visits further enhances our ability to understand and respond to medication impacts.\n    \n5.  **Longitudinal follow through is key:** Ongoing routine inquiry about side effects and monitoring relevant vital signs is a core practice expectation. Also routine should be recognition of co-occurring health conditions and coordination of care with the youth’s pediatric physician.\n    \n6.  **Focus on med compliance:** Compliance and non-compliance should be reviewed periodically. Use longer acting agents (eg, fluoxetine) when appropriate and work with kids and parents on developing more consistent medication use habits.\n    \n7.  **Review and reconsider:** Recognizing the failure of a medication to achieve desired results needs to be considered and it should trigger a reassessment of the diagnosis and treatment plan.\n    \n8.  **Beware of polypharmacy:** Multiple agents raise the risk of side effects. Combinations can have therapeutic benefits, but it is important to reassess the efficacy of all agents monitored for side effects, interactions, and other challenges.\n    \n9.  **Monitor sleep patterns:** Disturbances of sleep should be addressed behaviorally when possible, and pharmacologically when warranted.\n    \n10.  **Inquire about herbals and OTC agents:** Many patients and parents think that herbals, supplements, and other types of “natural” remedies are benign. Ask, or you may never be told. Learn more about these agents and work with families and youth to make mutual decisions on whether to continue them.\n    \n11.  **Check for other substances:** These include cannabis, alcohol, methamphetamine, psychedelics, heroin, or use of grandma’s codeine, sleeping pills, SSRIs, etc.\n    \n12.  **Learn about life changes:** Inquire about other changes in the child’s life—parental discord, changes in the family structure (siblings off to college), new or lost friends, changes in school, illnesses, accidents, bullying and everything else that can upset the applecart. All these may impact our patients’ functioning."}
{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/tachyphylaxis","markdown":"**Tachyphylaxis** is the continued or repeated exposure to a drug that may lead to a weakened pharmacological response. This thought to be due to diminished receptor sensitivity in response to the persistent stimulation by an agonist drug, which produces a diminished pharmacological response.\n\nThe pathophysiology of tachyphylaxis is distinct from tolerance. The desensitization process from tachyphylaxis can be due to a decrease in the number of receptors or an attenuation of the response because the drug has promoted neurotransmitter release in excess of presynaptic production. The presence of certain enzymes can limit cyclic AMP-based signalling, disrupt second messenger systems, and diminish the availability of receptors at the cell membrane.\n\n**Antidepressant tachyphylaxis** (also known as antidepressant tolerance, “poop-out,” or “breakthrough depression“) describes a condition in which a depressed patient loses a previously effective antidepressant treatment response despite staying on the same drug and dosage for maintenance treatment.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Keller, M.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/home","markdown":"The **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** plays a significant role in unconscious and automatic processes in the human body. As prescribers of medications, what you prescribe can have profound impacts on the ANS, and it is important to be aware of how and _why_ medications affect the ANS.\n\n### Central and Peripheral Nervous System[](#central-and-peripheral-nervous-system)\n\nThe nervous system can be broken down into:\n\n1.  **Central Nervous System** (CNS), your brain and spinal cord\n    \n2.  **Peripheral Nervous System** (PNS), which consists of:\n    \n\nThe **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** operates independently of the CNS (e.g. - you do not need to consciously tell your heart to beat faster when you run). However, the ANS can be influenced by the brain (e.g. - salivating at the smell of food).\n\nThe Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) has 2 parts:\n\n1.  **Sympathetic Nervous System** (SNS), also known as the “Fight-or-Flight” system\n    \n2.  **Parasympathetic Nervous System** (_also_ called the PNS), _usually_ (but not always!) causes the opposite effect of the SNS, also known as the “Rest-and-Digest” System\n    \n\n [![The Nervous System](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/nervous_system.png?w=700&tok=6e3ea0 \"The Nervous System\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/nervous_system.png \"meds:1-autonomic-pharmacology:nervous_system.png\") Fig. 1 : The Nervous System[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/nervous_system.png)\n\n [![The Innervation of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/side-effects/pns_and_cns.png?w=450&tok=b9ba5d \"The Innervation of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems\")](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/side-effects/pns_and_cns.png \"meds:side-effects:pns_and_cns.png\") Fig. 2 : The Innervation of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems[](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/_media/meds/side-effects/pns_and_cns.png)\n\nThe Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems exit the brain and spinal cord and enter “relay stations” known as a ganglion. The parasympathetic ganglia are located close to the organs they innervate. Sympathetic ganglia, on the other hand, are in the sympathetic chain (which runs along the spinal column) and are far away from the organs (see [figure 1](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/home#img_image1)). Messages from the brain pass from the _pre_ganglionic neuron, through the ganglion, to the _post_ganglionic neuron, and finally to the target organ.\n\nAcetylcholine (Ach) is the “preganglionic nerve to ganglion to postganglionic nerve” neurotransmitter for both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Acetylcholine is also the “postganglionic nerve to organ” neurotransmitter for the parasympathetic system (PNS)\n\nNorepinephrine (NE) is the “postganglionic nerve to organ” neurotransmitter for the sympathetic system (SNS)\n\nSo which neurotransmitter binds onto which receptor on the autonomic pathway?\n\n#### Neurotransmitters and Receptors[](#neurotransmitters-and-receptors)\n\n| Neurotransmitter | Acetylcholine (ACh) | Norepinephrine (NE), Epinephrine (E) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preganglionic neuron (SNS/PNS) |     | \\-  |\n| Ganglion (SNS/PNS) |     | \\-  |\n| Postganglionic neuron (SNS/PNS) |     | \\-  |\n| Postganglionic nerve to organ (PNS) |     | \\-  |\n| Postganglionic nerve to organ (SNS) | \\-  |     |\n| Receptor | Muscarinic (M) and nicotinic (N) receptors | Alpha (α) and beta (β) receptors |\n| Receptor Subtype Examples | M1, M2, M3 | α1, α2, β1, β2 |\n\n#### These Receptors Exist Outside the ANS Too![](#these-receptors-exist-outside-the-ans-too)\n\nDon't forget all of these receptors in the ANS exist elsewhere too. Like: nicotinic receptors in the addiction pathway, nicotine receptors in the neuromuscular junction, mediating skeletal muscle innervation, muscarinic receptors in the brain involved in Parkinson’s disease and movement disorders.\n\n#### Interesting Exceptions[](#interesting-exceptions)\n\n*   There is no parasympathetic innervation of blood vessels\n    \n*   Sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic nerves, but paradoxically use M receptors\n    \n*   Sexual arousal is parasympathetic but orgasm is sympathetic\n    \n*   The sympathetic innervation of the adrenal gland is directly from the spinal cord and uses acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter. The adrenal gland functions like a special form of ganglion which then secretes epinephrine directly into the bloodstream.\n    \n\nThe following table details the function and location of sympathetic receptors, as well as example agonists and antagonists.\n\n#### Alpha (α)Receptor Function and Location[](#alpha-α-receptor-function-and-location)\n\n| Receptor | Neurotransmitter | Receptor Type | Function | Location | Agonist | Antagonist |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alpha-1 (α1) | Norepinephrine | G-protein | Constriction of smooth muscles | • Blood vessels and skin piloerectors (vasoconstriction and goosebumps)  <br>• Sphincters (bladder, GI)  <br>• Uterus (contraction)  <br>• Eye (constriction of radial muscle, leading to pupillary **d**ilation (my**d**riasis) | • Epinephrine  <br>• Phenylephrine  <br>• Midodrine | • Prazosin (antihypertensive)  <br>• Tamsulosin  <br>• Terazosin  <br>• Trazodone (blockade can cause priapism)  <br>• Antipsychotics (α1-blockade can cause orthostatic hypotension) |\n| Alpha-2 (α2) | Norepinephrine | G-protein | Inhibition of the sympathetic ganglia (i.e. - decreasing SNS activity) | • Presynaptic ganglionic neurons  <br>• GI tract | • Clonidine, guanfacine (antihypertensive, helps with ADHD, tics) | • Mirtazapine, trazodone (antidepressant effect) |\n\n#### Alpha Agonists and Antagonists[](#alpha-agonists-and-antagonists)\n\n|     | Agonist | Non selective blocker | Selective blocker (-osin ending) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| α1  | • Epinephrine  <br>• Phenylephrine  <br>• Midodrine | • Phenoxybenzamine  <br>• Phentolamine | • Prazosin  <br>• Terazosin  <br>• Doxazosin  <br>• Tamsulosin |\n| α2  | • Clonidine  <br>• Guanfacine | • Phenoxybenzamine  <br>• Phentolamine | • Mirtazapine |\n\n#### Beta (β) Receptor Function and Location[](#beta-β-receptor-function-and-location)\n\n| Receptor | Function | Location | Agonist | Antagonist |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Beta-1 (β1) | Increases cardiac performance, liberation of energy, and conservation of water | • Heart  <br>• Fat cells (lipolysis)  <br>• Kidneys (releases renin to conserve water) | • Dobutamine (used as a positive inotrope for heart failure and cardiogenic shock) | • Atenolol  <br>• Bisporolol (selective β1 receptor antagonist)  <br>• Metoporolol (selective β1 receptor antagonist)  <br>• Propranolol (β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) |\n| Beta-2 (β2) | Relaxation of smooth muscles (e.g. in the lungs), and liberation of energy | • Lungs (bronchodilation)  <br>• Blood vessels in muscles (vasodilation)  <br>• uterus (uterine relaxation)  <br>• GI (intestinal relaxation)  <br>• Bladder (relaxation)  <br>• Liver (liberate glucose via glycogenolysis) | • Salbutamol \\[AKA Albuterol\\] (Short-acting β2 agonist, SABA)  <br>• Formoterol (Long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) | • Propranolol (β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) |\n\nβ1-selective antagonists (β1 > β2)\n\nNonselective antagonists (β1 = β2)\n\nMost of the time, the SNS and PNS are opposing each other. Therefore, to change this balance, one system can be strengthened, or the other weakened.\n\n#### Modulating Sympathetic Activity[](#modulating-sympathetic-activity-1)\n\n| To increase (↑) sympathetic activity | To decrease (↓) sympathetic activity |\n| --- | --- |\n| You want to increase stimulation of the α and β receptors:  <br><br>*   Give an α- or β-agonist (AKA adrenergic or sympathomimetic) that stimulates these receptors (e.g. - epinephrine)<br>*   Inhibit the breakdown or removal of endogenous (the body’s own) norepinephrine or epinephrine (e.g. - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor like venlafaxine) | You want to decrease stimulation of the α and β receptors:  <br><br>*   Give an α- or β-antagonist (AKA anti-adrenergic or sympatholytic) that blocks these receptors (e.g. - beta-blocker like propranolol)<br>*   Give a drug to “turn down” the ganglion (e.g. - ganglionic blocker like hexamethonium, rarely used these days) |\n\nThe following table details the function and location of parasympathetic receptors, as well as example agonists and antagonists.\n\n### Muscarinic (M) and Nicotinic (N)[](#muscarinic-m-and-nicotinic-n)\n\n#### Muscarinic (M) and Nicotinic (N) Receptor Function and Location[](#muscarinic-m-and-nicotinic-n-receptor-function-and-location)\n\n| Receptor | Function | Location | Agonist | Antagonist |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nicotinic (N) | “Nerve to nerve” and “nerve to muscle” communication | • Sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia  <br>• Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) | • Nicotine  <br>• Varenicline  <br>• Succinylcholine (indirect anticholinergic)\\* | • Pancuronium  <br>• Vecuronium |\n| Muscarinic (M) | Opposes _most_ sympathetic actions at the level of the organs | • Lungs (bronchoconstriction)  <br>• Heart (bradycardia, decreased conduction, decreased contractility)  <br>• Sphincters of GI and bladder (relaxes)  <br>• Bladder wall (constriction)  <br>• GI (intestinal contraction)  <br>• Eye (contraction of the circular muscle = pupilary constriction/miosis)  <br>• Eye (contraction of the ciliary muscle = focus for near vision)  <br>• Glands: lacrimal, salivary, bronchial (secretions) | • Pilocarpine (stimulates secretion of large amounts of saliva and sweat, and increases aqueous humour turnover in open angle glaucoma)  <br>• Methacholine | • Atropine (non-selective antagonism), causes tachycardia  <br>• Benztropine (selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist)  <br>• Ipratropium (non-selective antagonism), bronchodilation  <br>• Tiotropium (non-selective antagonism), bronchodilation  <br>• Scopolamine  <br>• Hydroxyzine  <br>• Diphenhydramine “Benadryl” (non-selective antagonism)  <br>• Dimenhydrinate “Gravol”  <br>• Oxybutynin  <br>• Procyclidine (non-selective antagonism), for idiopathic or drug-induced Parkinson's |\n\n#### How Does Succinylcholine Work?[](#how-does-succinylcholine-work)\n\nSuccinylcholine is a direct nicotinic receptor **agonist** but is used clinically as an indirect **anticholinergic**. It is a direct cholinergic agonist because it binds to the same binding site as acetylcholine and activates the receptor in the same manner. However, unlike endogenous acetylcholine, succinylcholine activates the nicotinic receptors so intensely that a depolarizing block occurs immediately followed by a desensitizing block (think of the phases of the action potential). This is what gives succinylcholine its paralyzing (i.e. - muscle relaxant) effects in anesthesia. In contrast, non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), such as pancuronium, are direct cholinergic antagonists.\n\n#### Muscarinic Subtypes[](#muscarinic-subtypes-1)\n\n| Muscarinic Receptor Subtype | Location | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| M1  | Central nervous system | Involved in perception, attention, and cognition. Delirium is also associated with the antagonism of post-synaptic M1 receptors. |\n| M2  | Brain, heart | Decreases heart rate below baseline normal sinus rhythm by slowing the speed of depolarization. |\n| M3  | Smooth muscles, salivary glands | Causes contraction of smooth muscle, including bronchoconstriction and bladder voiding. |\n| M4  | Brain, lungs, salivary glands | There is a possible role for M4 receptors in regulating salivary protein secretion.

These medications work on the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Remember that the PNS compliments the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and this combines to make up the [autonomic nervous system (ANS)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/1-autonomic-pharmacology/home \"meds:1-autonomic-pharmacology:home\"). As a result, these medications can have a variety of side effects and toxicities due to their effects on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The toxic effects of these medications (depending on dose) can range from mild symptoms to severe autonomic impairment and delirium requiring intensive care.\n\n[Antidepressants](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/home \"meds:antidepressants:home\") and [antipsychotic](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\") medications have anticholinergic properties, and this is often forgotten. On the flip side, dementia medications and [acetylcholinesterase inhibitors](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/donepezil \"meds:dementia:donepezil\") have cholinergic effects. It is important to consider the impact of anticholinergic and cholinergic side effects; sometimes the side effects far outweigh the benefits of the medications!\n\nAnticholinergics are also known as antimuscarinics, cholinergic blockers, or parasympatholytics. They block or inhibit the actions of acetylcholine, and reduce activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. The mechanism of action of anticholinergics can be one of the following:\n\n1.  Competitive antagonists of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites\n    \n2.  Inhibits the transmission of signals at cholinergic receptors\n    \n\n#### Naming Alert![](#naming-alert)\n\nAnticholinergic medications really should be called **antimuscarinics**, since most drugs target muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (and rarely target the nicotinic receptors).\n\n#### Contraindications[](#contraindications)\n\nThe following conditions can be absolute or relative contraindications to using an anticholinergic medication:\n\n*   Older adults already with high anticholinergic burden (e.g. - already taking anticholinergic medications for urinary incontinence, COPD)\n    \n*   Dementia (dementia correlates with reduced acetylcholine in the brain and thus can become worse with the use of anticholinergics)\n    \n*   Glaucoma\n    \n*   Hyperthyroidism\n    \n*   Tachyarrhythmias\n    \n*   Prostate hypertrophy\n    \n\n#### Medications/Substances with Anticholinergic Effects[](#medications-substances-with-anticholinergic-effects)\n\n| Classes | Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Antidepressants](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/home \"meds:antidepressants:home\") | [Tricylic antidepressants](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/tca/home \"meds:antidepressants:tca:home\"), [paroxetine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/paroxetine \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:paroxetine\") (most antidepressants have very weak anticholinergic activity, e.g. -[bupropion](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ndri/bupropion \"meds:antidepressants:ndri:bupropion\"), [mirtazapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/nassa/mirtazapine \"meds:antidepressants:nassa:mirtazapine\"), [sertraline](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/sertraline \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:sertraline\"), [fluoxetine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/fluoxetine \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:fluoxetine\"), [venlafaxine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/snri/venlafaxine \"meds:antidepressants:snri:venlafaxine\"), [citalopram](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/citalopram \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:citalopram\"), [escitalopram](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antidepressants/ssri/escitalopram \"meds:antidepressants:ssri:escitalopram\")) |\n| [Antipsychotics](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/home \"meds:antipsychotics:home\") | Low potency antipsychotics are higher risk (e.g. -

The mechanism of action of cholinergics can be one of the following:\n\n1.  **Direct-acting cholinergic agonists**\n    \n2.  **Indirect-acting cholinergic agonists**\n    \n\n#### Contraindicated Conditions[](#contraindicated-conditions)\n\nThe following conditions can be absolute or relative contraindications to using a cholinergic medication:[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)\n\n*   Pulmonary disease (COPD/bronchial asthma)\n    \n*   Peptic ulcer disease (may use with caution)\n    \n*   Arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation)\n    \n*   Coronary vascular disease\n    \n*   Angle-closure glaucoma\n    \n*   Hyperthyroidism\n    \n*   Intestinal resection or anastomosis\n    \n*   Urinary obstruction\n    \n*   Orthostatic hypotension\n    \n*   Severe miosis\n    \n\n#### Medications/Substances with Cholinergic Effects[](#medications-substances-with-cholinergic-effects)\n\n| Classes | Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| (Acetyl)cholinesterase Inhibitors | [Donepezil](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/donepezil \"meds:dementia:donepezil\"), [galantamine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/galantamine \"meds:dementia:galantamine\"), [rivastigmine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dementia/rivastigmine \"meds:dementia:rivastigmine\"), pyridostigmine |\n| Ocular medications | Pilocarpine (for glaucoma) |\n| Respiratory agents | Methacholine (bronchoprovocation test to diagnose asthma) |\n| Organophosphate insecticides | Sarin gas |\n\nAs one might expect, the side effects from cholinergic medications are usually the opposite from that of anticholinergics. Cholinergics cause a “flood” of acetylcholine, making things as “wet as the ocean.”\n\n#### Mnemonic[](#mnemonic-1)\n\nThe mnemonic `**SLUDGE**` can be used to remember the symptoms of cholinergic overload and toxicity:\n\n*   `**S**` - Salivation\n    \n*   `**L**` - Lacrimation\n    \n*   `**U**` - Urination\n    \n*   `**D**` - Diaphoresis\n    \n*   `**G**` - GI Upset\n    \n*   `**E**` - Emesis\n    \n*   Bradycardia and pin-point pupils can result as well!\n    \n\n#### Cholinergic Effects on the Body[](#cholinergic-effects-on-the-body)\n\n| System | Adverse Effects |\n| --- | --- |\n| Neurological | • Dizziness  <br>• Drowsiness |\n| Dermatological and Glands | • Increased sweating, salivation, lacrimation, gastric, and tracheobronchial secretions |\n| Cardiac | • Bradycardia  <br>• Cardiac arrest |\n| Respiatory | • Bronchospasms, asthma attacks |\n| Ocular | • Contraction of the iris (miosis) and accommodation spasm |\n| Vascular | • Hypotension |\n| Gastrointestinal | • Increased GI motility, causing: peristalsis increase, sphincters relaxing, resulting in abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and increased voiding |\n| Genitourinary | • The detrusor muscle contracts, while the bladder trigone and sphincter relax, causing voiding of the bladder |\n\nThe concurrent administration of both anticholinergic and cholinergic drugs can cause an antagonistic response, and reduce the pharmacodynamic effects of one or both of the medications. Older adults are particularly susceptible, due to age-related decreases in endogenous acetylcholine.\n\n## Management and Treatment[](#management-and-treatment)\n\nIf a patient is symptomatic and you suspect anticholinergic or cholinergic side effects, the most important thing is to review the indication for the use of the medications! Afterwards, if the medication is still felt to be necessary, either try to reduce the dose of the medication, or try to manage symptomatically (e.g. - use of stool softeners, eye drops, etc.).\n\n#### Anticholinergic vs. Cholinergic Overdose Management[](#anticholinergic-vs-cholinergic-overdose-management)\n\n|     | Anticholinergic Overdose | Cholinergic Overdose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Summary | A precipitous drop in acetylcholine, leading to a drop in PNS activity, making things as “dry as the dessert” | A flood of acetylcholine, making things as “wet as the ocean” |\n| Treatment | • Benzodiazepines for seizures and agitation  <br>• Physostigmine is the main treatment: it inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity to increase the amount ACh available (EXCEPT in cases of TCA overdose, where it is CONTRAINDICATED, because it will lead to life-threatening bradyarrhythmias)[\\[5\\]](#refnotes:1:note5)[\\[6\\]](#refnotes:1:note6) | • Atropine 2mg every few minutes until symptoms are relieved  <br>• Since atropine only targets muscarinic receptors, the flooded nicotinic receptors are left untouched. Therefore to treat the neuromuscular symptoms (weakness/fasciculations) you need to add pralidoxime which inactivates the agent at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) |\n\n##### For Providers[](#for-providers)\n\n##### Reading[](#reading)\n\n**[2)](#refnotes:1:ref2)** [Coupland, C.

There are unfortunately few well-designed studies to address this problem, and there are also high placebo-response rates for treatments.\n\nMost antidepressants modulate serotonin, and elevated serotonin levels (via increased stimulation/agonism) are thought to cause sexual dysfunction.

Discontinuation symptoms typically start 1 to 3 days after the treatment is stopped, whereas relapse symptoms are unlikely to become evident for another 2 to 3 weeks. Discontinuation symptoms are also unlikely to occur in patients who have been on antidepressants for less than 7 weeks. In addition, discontinuation symptoms will also resolve within a couple of days after the antidepressant is restarted.

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/non-benzo-anxiolytics/hydroxyzine","markdown":"**Hydroxyzine** is a first-generation antihistamine (and anticholingeric) with a variety of uses and indications, including uses as an anxiolytic.\n\nHydroxyzine's predominant mechanism of action is as a potent and selective histamine (H1) receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative effects. Unlike other first-generation antihistamines like [diphenhydramine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/anticholinergic/diphenhydramine \"meds:anticholinergic:diphenhydramine\") (tradename: _Benadryl_), hydroxyzine has very low affinity for the muscarinic (acetylcholine) receptors. Therefore it is not a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which means it has very little anticholinergic side effects.\n\nHydroxyzine has also been shown to act as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the α1-adrenergic receptor. The weak anti-serotonergic effects of hydroxyzine make it useful as an anxiolytic, as other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety.\n\n#### First vs. Second Generation Antihistamines[](#first-vs-second-generation-antihistamines)\n\nHydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine, which means it crosses the blood–brain barrier easily and exerts effects on the central nervous system (which explains it sedative and anxiolytic effects). Newer, second-generation antihistamines like cetirizine (tradename: _Reactine_) are less able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Thus, they are marketed as non-drowsy and have less side effects such as memory impairment.\n\nBecause of its antihistamine effects, it can be used for the treatment of severe cases of pruritus, hyperalgesia, and motion sickness-induced nausea. It has also been used in some cases to relieve the effects of opioid withdrawal.\n\nEven though it is an effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic, it shares virtually none of the abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. Due to its antagonistic effects on several receptor systems in the brain, hydroxyzine also has anxiolytic, anti-obsessive, and antipsychotic properties."}

It is particularly relevant in individuals on [clozapine](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/second-gen-atypical/7-clozapine \"meds:antipsychotics:second-gen-atypical:7-clozapine\"), but applies to anyone on antipsychotics. Unfortunately, antipsychotic-related constipation is not well researched, making general treatment recommendations dependent on expert opinion and limited studies.[\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1)\n\nConstipation is very common in clozapine use and can affect up to 50% of patients.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2) It is critical for every patient on clozapine to have bowel monitoring for constipation. Clozapine has the potential to decrease GI motility, and is associated with risk of paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, bowel perforation, and in rare cases, death.[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) If other anticholingerics are also being used, then the prescribing clinician needs to be even more vigilant about bowel monitoring, since anticholingeric effects are additive. In addition, the risk of medication-related constipation also increases with age.

It is important to be aware of this so that individuals from certain ethnic groups do not have to stop clozapine unnecessarily.\n\n#### Morning Pseudoneutropenia[](#morning-pseudoneutropenia)\n\nSome patients have a very pronounced diurnal variation in their number of circulating neutrophils.[\\[11\\]](#refnotes:1:note11)[\\[12\\]](#refnotes:1:note12) Thus, morning blood work may reveal a critical WBC count that falls below the normal range. In this case, it is wise to repeat a neutrophil count in the afternoon, before deciding to change clozapine treatment.[\\[13\\]](#refnotes:1:note13)\n\n#### Don't Forget to Continue Bloodwork Monitoring![](#dont-forget-to-continue-bloodwork-monitoring)\n\nWhen discontinuing clozapine, a weekly white blood cell and absolute neutrophil count still needs ordered in the 4 weeks post-discontinuation![\\[14\\]](#refnotes:1:note14)\n\nCigarette smoking induces the CYP1A2 isoenzyme which can lead to lower levels of clozapine. It can reduce clozapine plasma levels by up to 50% and higher doses may be required in smokers than in nonsmokers. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarettes induce CYP1A2 activity, which increases the metabolism of clozapine.[\\[20\\]](#refnotes:1:note20) Nicotine replacement products (patches, lozenges, nasal spray, inhalers, and gum) on the other hand, do not induce CYP1A2. The impact of electronic cigarettes and vaping is less clear, and there may be a potential to induce CYP1A2 as well (though less than cigarettes).[\\[21\\]](#refnotes:1:note21)\n\n#### Quitting, Stopping, or Starting Smoking?[](#quitting-stopping-or-starting-smoking)\n\nPatients who are smokers and on clozapine and decide to quit smoking face a higher risk of seizures (due to sudden increases in plasma clozapine)! These individuals may need up to a 50% reduction of their dose of clozapine. A patient who smokes at least 7-12 cigarettes a day and on a stable dose of clozapine may need a lower daily clozapine dosage when admitted to a smoke-free facility. Clozapine should be lowered by 30% to 40% over 4 to 7 days to reduce the risk of clozapine toxicity. If the patient starts smoking again, clozapine may need to be increased by as much as 1.5 times over a period of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nSedation, hypotension and seizure activity are most commonly correlated with higher plasma levels of clozapine.[\\[22\\]](#refnotes:1:note22)\n\n**Clozapine-induced fever** is a benign but common side-effect that can occur in up to half of all patients on treatment.[\\[23\\]](#refnotes:1:note23) Fevers typically last for up to 2-3 days, and occur in the first month of treatment. Other differential diagnoses to consider include [neuroleptic malignant syndrome](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/antipsychotics/nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome \"meds:antipsychotics:nms-neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\") and clozapine-induced myocarditis.\n\n**Hypersialorrhea** (hypersalivation) is the excessive production of saliva. **Clozapine-induced hypersalivation/sialorrhea (CIH, or CIS)** is a common side effect related to clozapine use (but can also occur in other antipsychotics).[\\[24\\]](#refnotes:1:note24) Sialorrhea can range from being mildly uncomfortable drooling and excessive saliva, to potentially life-threatening conditions, such as parotitis, choking, and aspiration. Sialorrhea is _not_ dose-related and can occur at any point during treatment. Although clozapine has many anticholinergic properties, the cause of CIS is thought to be due to clozapine _agonism_ at the muscarinic (M4) receptors and blockade of a-2 adrenergic receptors, which increases salivary production and flow.[\\[25\\]](#refnotes:1:note25)\n\nCIS can be treated with an muscarinic receptor antagonist (i.e. - an antimuscarinic/anticholinergic) such as atropine or ipratropium, which can administered sublingually at night time.[\\[26\\]](#refnotes:1:note26)[\\[27\\]](#refnotes:1:note27) Common treatment regimens include:\n\n**Constipation** is very common and can affect up to 50% of patients.[\\[29\\]](#refnotes:1:note29) It is critical for every patient on clozapine to have bowel monitoring for constipation. Clozapine has the potential to decrease GI motility, and is associated with risk of paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, bowel perforation, and in rare cases, death.[\\[30\\]](#refnotes:1:note30) If other anticholingerics are also being used, then the prescribing clinician needs to be even more vigilant about bowel monitoring, since anticholingeric effects are additive. In addition, the risk of medication-related constipation also increases with age. Other conditions like diabetes mellitus can also further worsen constipation due to autonomic neuropathy.\n\n#### Don't Forget About Constipation![](#dont-forget-about-constipation)\n\nConstipation can be **life-threatening**. Severe constipation can cause bowel obstruction, sepsis and death. More deaths are caused by clozapine-induced ileus/megacolon than by agranulocytosis.[\\[31\\]](#refnotes:1:note31)\n\n#### Before Starting Clozapine[](#before-starting-clozapine)\n\n*   Obtain a baseline bowel movement history\n    \n*   Counsel patients on recognition and reporting of constipation.\n    \n*   Review all current medications and anticholinergic medications and stop other constipating medications wherever possible.\n    \n*   If baseline constipation exists, begin laxative treatment immediately.\n    \n\n#### Constipation Management[](#constipation-management)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st line | Osmostic agents:  <br>• Polyethylene glycol (PEG): start 17 grams daily, and increase to 17 grams BID as needed (this is  <br>beyond manufacturers’ recommended dose).  <br>• Lactulose: start 15-30 mL daily, and increase to 30 mL BID  <br>_Note: Combining lactulose and PEG 3350 combined is not a rational pharmacotherapy due to overlapping mechanisms._ |\n| 2nd line | Stimulant laxatives:  <br>• Sennosides  <br>• Bisacodyl |\n| 3rd line | Fibre and bulk-forming products _may_ be helpful, but can also worsen constipation in underlying dehydration and should be used **cautiously**. |\n| Adjunctive | Dietary and exercise interventions should be considered as adjunct to laxative therapy as they are not likely to improve clozapine-induced constipation alone. |\n| Not recommended | There is no evidence for the use of surfactant agents (“stool softeners”) like docusate sodium for chronic constipation. These agents only lower the surface tension of stool, but are not effective at preventing and treating medication-induced constipation.[\\[32\\]](#refnotes:1:note32) |\n\n### Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia[](#agranulocytosis-and-neutropenia)\n\n**Agranulocytosis** (absolute neutrophil count, or ANC, less than 500/µL) is the most serious adverse reaction to clozapine. To prevent this from occurring, regular hematological monitoring is required, which reduces the risk of agranulocytosis by 20-fold. Agranulocytosis tends to develop during the first 6 months of treatment, whereas neutropenia (ANC between 0.5-1.5 x 109/L) can occur at any time.\n\n### Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy[](#myocarditis-and-cardiomyopathy)\n\n**Myocarditis** and **cardiomyopathy** are the two serious cardiac-related adverse events to monitor for, both during initiation of treatment and throughout the course of treatment.[\\[33\\]](#refnotes:1:note33)\n\n#### Clozapine-induced Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy[](#clozapine-induced-myocarditis-and-cardiomyopathy)\n\n|     | Onset | % of patients | Signs and Symptoms | Pathophysiology | Bloodwork | Investigations and Treatment |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Myocarditis | Generally occurs within first few weeks (14-21 days) of clozapine initiation. Mortality rates as high as 50% have been reported, when undetected. | 0.2% | Myocarditis has non-specific symptoms, including fever, tachycardia and chest pain. There may be signs of heart failure such as dyspnea (especially while supine) or dry cough. Other symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, dysuria or rashes. | The pathophysiology of clozapine-associated myocarditis not well understood but is not dose-dependent. | • CBC (↑ WBC, ↑ eosinophils)  <br>• CRP (↑)\\*  <br>• Troponin, BNP, CK, ESR | Echocardiogram, CXR. Treatment includes stopping clozapine, and usual treatment for myocarditis. Diagnosis is not straightforward, and suspected cases should be referred urgently for a cardiology opinion. |\n| Cardiomyopathy | Usually occurs later in clozapine treatment compared to myocarditis. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for cardiomyopathy throughout clozapine treatment, regardless of how long a patient has been on clozapine. | 0.02–0.1%[\\[34\\]](#refnotes:1:note34) | Signs of heart failure, flu-like symptoms, cough, fever, sinus tachycardia/ palpitations, fatigue, hypotension and chest discomfort.[\\[35\\]](#refnotes:1:note35) | Poorly understood, may be secondary to untreated, acute clozapine-induced myocarditis.[\\[36\\]](#refnotes:1:note36) | • CBC (↑ WBC, ↑ eosinophils)  <br>• CRP (↑)\\*  <br>• Troponin, BNP, CK, ESR | Echocardiogram (reduced ejection fraction), ECG. Treatment includes stopping clozapine and usual treatment for heart failure. |\n\n#### Bloodwork and monitoring for the first month[](#bloodwork-and-monitoring-for-the-first-month)\n\nWhen doing clozapine monitoring, remember that elevated CRP means _general_ inflammation, and when there is also elevated troponin this means there is _localization_ of that inflammation (to the heart).\n\n#### Bloodwork and monitoring for the first month[](#bloodwork-and-monitoring-for-the-first-month-1)\n\nAlthough there are no universal guidelines, some monitoring protocols suggest monitoring troponin and CRP every week for the first month, plus vital signs every other day.[\\[37\\]](#refnotes:1:note37) Symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, plus elevated troponin (>2 times the upper limit of normal) and CRP (>100 mg/L) is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of clozapine-induced myocarditis.[\\[38\\]](#refnotes:1:note38)\n\n**Seizure** risk increases in a dose-dependent manner with clozapine, and is most frequent in patients with serum levels above 1000 μg/L, or at doses more than 500 mg per day. Clozapine-induced seizures can be managed and prevented with either valproate or lamotrigine. Valproate has the most data to support its use and it is widely regarded as the drug of choice. Adjunctive antiepileptic treatment is recommended as prophylaxis against seizures and myoclonus when plasma levels are above 600 μg/L. There is also a relationship between clozapine dose, plasma level, and the likelihood of an abnormal EEG.[\\[39\\]](#refnotes:1:note39)\n\nMultiple factors can affect the true plasma level of clozapine. Plasma levels are generally lower in smokers, younger ages, and males. Conversely, plasma levels are generally higher in Asian patients, and they may have a higher risk of seizures even at low doses of clozapine.[\\[40\\]](#refnotes:1:note40)\n\n### Obstetric and Fetal[](#obstetric-and-fetal)\n\n##### Documentation[](#documentation)\n\nWe reviewed the common side effects of clozapine:  elevated heart rate, ECG abnormalities, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, drowsiness, dizziness, falls, insomnia, akathisia, excess saliva production, dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and heartburn, enuresis, EPS. Potentially rare, but more serious risks:  agranulocytosis,  tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (muscle stiffness, fever, sudden rise in blood pressure, agitation and confusion), myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, stroke, blood clots, lowered blood cells (such as platelets and eosinophils), aspiration pneumonia, dysregulation of body temperature, arrhythmias, suicidal thinking, bowel obstruction and seizures. We also reiterated that sudden cardiac death is possible with patients who are prone to arrhythmias and QTc prolongation. Reviewed that patients with dementia have a known risk for death and stroke like events with use of neuroleptics. \n\n**[3)](#refnotes:1:ref3)** Schatzberg, AF, Nemeroff, C .

{"url":"https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/meds/dopamine-agonists/carbidopa-levodopa","markdown":"**Carbidopa-Levodopa** (Tradename: _Sinemet_), also known as levocarb, is a combination drug of carbidopa and levodopa used in the treatment of [Parkinson's Disease (PD)](https://www.psychiatry.dev/db1/geri/parkinsons \"geri:parkinsons\").\n\nLevodopa (a dihydroxyphenylalanine) is the immediate precursor of dopamine. Unlike dopamine, it can be taken orally and can cross the blood-brain barrier. When ingested alone, levodopa is rapidly converted to dopamine outside the CNS. Thus carbidopa, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI), is added to inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the CNS.\n\nPatients usually need to be on at least 2 weeks of treatment before improvements are seen. A single dose will start working within 10 minutes with a total duration effect of about 5 hours.\n\nHigh doses can cause dopamine toxicity, causing hypertension, GI upset, blurred vision, and hallucinations.\n\n**Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID)** can occur from long‐term use of levodopa, and not caused by the underlying Parkinson's Disease. [\\[1\\]](#refnotes:1:note1) Different types of movement disorders are seen in LID, including chorea, ballism, dystonia, myoclonus, or combination of any of these movements. These dyskinesias are seen in the neck, facial muscles, jaw, tongue, hip, shoulder, trunk, and limb or may appear as involuntary flexion of toes. These dyskinesias can often be very debilitating, and even more so than the original Parkinson's symptoms.\n\nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) is a complication that affects up to 19% of PD patients who undergo a dopamine agonist taper. It was initially described in 2010 as a severe stereotypical cluster of psychiatric and physical symptoms occurring with dopamine agonist withdrawal.[\\[2\\]](#refnotes:1:note2)[\\[3\\]](#refnotes:1:note3) The symptoms of DAWS include anxiety, panic attacks, dysphoria, depression, agitation, irritability, suicidal ideation, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, generalized pain, and drug cravings.\n\nThe on-off phenomenon is a consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by a switch between mobility and immobility, which occurs as an end-of-dose or “wearing off” worsening of motor function or, much less commonly, as sudden and unpredictable motor fluctuations.[\\[4\\]](#refnotes:1:note4)"}
